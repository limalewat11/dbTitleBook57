<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Gospel Call and True Conversion (Recovering the Gospel)</h2><p>The apostle Paul gave the gospel the first place in his preaching, endeavored with all his might to proclaim it clearly, and even went so far as to pronounce a curse upon all those who would pervert its truth. Yet how sad it is that many, even among those considering themselves evangelicals, have reduced the gospel message to a few trite statements to be repeated, and view conversion as a mere human decision. In <i>The Gospel Call and True Conversion</i>, Paul Washer challenges such easy believism as he examines the real meaning of things like faith, repentance, and receiving Christ. He also deals extensively with the effects of saving grace that God promises in the new covenant; namely, the creation of new hearts and new people.<p> <b>Table of Contents: </b><br> Series Preface<br> <b>PART ONE: The Gospel Call </b><br> 1.

Paul now serves as one of the laborers with the HeartCry Missionary Society. He and his wife, Charo, have three children: Ian, Evan, and RowaIn an age awash with easy believism, we need voices like Paul Washer's that remind us of <i>The Gospel Call and True Conversion</i>. We are all tempted to believe that we are beyond the basics and in need of something more something new. However, Washer reminds us that there is nothing more important and more relevant than getting the gospel right, making the gospel clear, and trusting that gospel to do its work of calling, saving, and securing a people to God and for God. Praise God for the gospel and books like this that help us know, understand, and love it more deeply. --Voddie Baucham, pastor of preaching at Grace Family Baptist Church in Spring, Texas, and author of The Ever-Loving Truth<br><br>Being a Christian is not just a matter of making a decision for Jesus or turning over a new leaf. It is a miracle of grace in which a sinner is brought by God's power from death to life. In <i>The Gospel Call and True Conversion</i>, Paul Washer brilliantly and clearly helps the reader understand that truth, carefully opening the Scriptures and explaining how the power of the gospel ought to impact our lives as Christians. A much-needed, pastoral, and challenging book! --Greg Gilbert, senior pastor of Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, and author of What Is the Gospel?<br><br>By God's sovereign grace, Paul Washer's ministry has been particularly blessed to instruct this generation in the basics of true conversion and the gospel call. I highly commend this careful but simple treatment of these vital issues. May God bless it to the preparation of His people to share the gospel of peace and to the salvation of many persons. --Sam Waldron, academic dean and professor of systematic theology at the Midwest Center for Theological Studies, Owensboro, Kentucky</p><h2>Real Artists Don&#39;t Starve: Timeless Strategies for Thriving in the New Creative Age</h2><p><p><strong>Bestselling author and creativity expert Jeff Goins dismantles the myth that being creative is a hindrance to success by revealing how an artistic temperament is in fact a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</strong></p><p><strong>The Starving Artist Is a Myth</strong></p><p>We&#x2019;ve heard it a thousand times: There&#x2019;s no money in art. It&#x2019;s too risky. You&#x2019;ll&nbsp;<em>starve</em>. So, we end up chasing more stable careers. We become lawyers and doctors and bankers instead of poets and filmmakers and painters. We settle. And in the end our best work suffers.</p><p>The truth is we do not have to choose between a creative life and a prosperous one. In fact, many of history&#x2019;s most creative minds&#x2014;from Michelangelo to Shakespeare to Steve Jobs&#x2014;succeeded&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>because they succumbed to the myth of the starving artist but precisely because they didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Today we live in a New Renaissance, an era of unprecedented opportunity in which you can share your creative work without fear of suffering or starving. Drawing lessons from the likes of Jim Henson, C. S. Lewis, Dr. Dre, and many others, bestselling author and entrepreneur Jeff Goins invites us to drop the myths, worries, and flat-out lies that have been drilled into us our entire lives and instead reveals an empowering truth: Real artists don&#x2019;t starve.

At an opulent resort in Montego Bay, Margot hustles to send her younger sister, Thandi, to school. Taught as a girl to trade her sexuality for survival, Margot is ruthlessly determined to shield Thandi from the same fate. When plans for a new hotel threaten their village, Margot sees not only an opportunity for her own financial independence but also perhaps a chance to admit a shocking secret: her forbidden love for another woman. As they face the impending destruction of their community, each woman&#x2015;fighting to balance the burdens she shoulders with the freedom she craves&#x2015;must confront long-hidden scars. From a much-heralded new writer, <em>Here Comes the Sun</em> offers a dramatic glimpse into a vibrant, passionate world most outsiders see simply as paradise.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2016:</strong> <em>Here Comes the Sun</em> is a brilliant, gut-punch of a debut novel. Set on the white sand beaches, resorts and shacks of Jamaica, Nicole Dennis-Benn tells the story of four Jamaican women as they struggle to find their independence amidst the sprawling resorts that both provide and threaten their livelihood. Margot is brash and brawny. She works at a hotel, hustling to ensure the guests are attended to&#x2014;in all manners of speaking. Her younger sister, Thandi. struggles with her identity as a black woman in a school full of white wealthy students. Their mother, Delores, is as unforgiving as she is brutal and her decisions will break your heart, as they did her daughter&#x2019;s. And then there&#x2019;s Verdene, a smart ostracized gay woman who is vilified for her sexuality. I fell hard for these characters &#x2013; for their defiance and vulnerability, for their grit and morally ambiguous choices &#x2013; and for the island-life that Nicole Dennis-Benn has captured. You can almost feel the hot stick of the sun while reading, the sweat of work and the incongruities of wealth and power, sexuality and love. <em>Here Comes the Sun</em> is a bright story about the dark side of tourism, sex and relationships, of getting ahead...And you will tan from its rays. <em>--Al Woodworth, The Amazon Book Review</em>Nicole Dennis-Benn is a Lambda Literary Award winner and New York Foundation for the Arts Artist Fellowship recipient.

Unfortunately most of these books are completely focused on individual trade structures, and the ones that focus on risk management are completely weighted to the equity side.

This new book by Dennis Chen and Mark Sebastian bridges that gap.

A university graduate and modern pentathlete, he suffered both a career�ending injury and a painful breakup, leaving him suddenly adrift. The son of prominent Canadian equestrians, Maynard decided to spend the next year as a &#x201c;working student.&#x201d; In the horse industry, working students aspire to become professional riders or trainers, and willingly trade labor for hands�on education. Here Maynard chronicles his experiences�good and bad�and we follow along as one year becomes three, what began as a casual adventure gradually transforms, and a life's purpose comes sharply into focus.</p> <p>Over time, Maynard evolved under the critical eyes of Olympians, medal winners, and world�renowned figures in the horse world, including Anne Kursinski, Johann Hinnemann, Ingrid Klimke, David and Karen O'Connor, Bruce Logan, and Ian Millar. He was ignored, degraded, encouraged, and praised. He was hired and fired, told he had the &#x201c;wrong body type to ride&#x201d; and that he had found his &#x201c;destiny.&#x201d; He got married and lost loved ones. Through it all he studied the horse, and human nature, and how the two can find balance. And in that journey, he may have found himself.</p></p><p>Tik Maynard began riding with the Vancouver Pony Club, in Southlands, British Columbia. After achieving his &#x2018;A&#x2019; rating, he began competing in Modern Pentathlon, where he represented Canada at three World Championships, and the 2007 Pan�American Games. In 2008, Maynard began a journey to improve his riding. From Germany to Florida, from Alberta to Texas, and from Florida to New Jersey, Maynard was willing to go wherever he had to, to learn from the best. Along the way he discovered something more important: horsemanship. It is that idea that continues to motivate him. Today, Maynard searches out knowledge from many sources, but his most important mentors are his parents and his wife. He is married to US Eventing Team Member Sinead Halpin. Together they run Copperline Farm in Citra, Florida. Maynard has always been a passionate book lover. He has written a children's story, published by REAL magazine, has won the Malahat Review Open Season Award, and has twice been shortlisted for the CBC Literary Awards for his non�fiction works.&#x201c;Maynard's writing style is fantastic. There are so many little quoteable gems in the book that I think half of it would be yellow if you tried to highlight them all. The words flow easily, nothing feels forced or overworked, and most of all it seems very honest it's been a long time since a horse book has effected me this much, on a visceral level. It makes me want to do better, to be better, and to learn more. Any book that can leave you feeling that way, inspired, is worth buying.&#x201d;<strong> <i>The900FacebookPony.com</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Readers interested in horsemanship will certainly find that here, but Maynard's journey of self-discovery will appeal to a wider audience as well.&#x201d;<strong><i> Booklist</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A horseman's greatest asset is the ability to accept what is being presented, learn from it, and then turn it into something special. Having worked with Tik Maynard, I can say first-hand that he is indeed one of those special horsemen. This book does a wonderful job illustrating the effort has gone through to help get him there. A great read!&#x201d; <strong>Mark Rashid</strong>, Renowned Horseman and Author<br><br>&#x201c; With rave reviews from such iconic horseman as Monty Roberts, Pat Parelli, Jonathan Field, and David O&#x2019;Connor, this book is a must-read for every horse lover out there. An inspiring story about horses, life, and everything in between, Tik Maynard dives into what makes him a true horseman.&#x201d;<strong> <i>Horse Journals</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An emotional roller coaster of a journey we follow along while Tik [Maynard] blossoms from a shy, struggling working student in Germany to a young professional who is able to admit his own shortcomings and grow from them. His story is one of love and laughter, with plenty of life lessons learned along the way. It is apparent that Tik is not only a skilled horseman, but a talented writer and story-teller as well.&#x201d;<strong> JumperNation.com</strong><br><br><p>"Both a fascinating record of a young man&#x2019;s quest to find his place, and a vivid portrait of an industry and a culture built upon on one of our most ancient and transformative relationships, that between the human and the horse. Acutely observed, vividly told, and not to be missed."<strong> Kathy Page</strong>, Author of <i>Alphabet</i> and <i>Paradise &amp; Elsewhere</i></p><p> </p><p>"It&#x2019;s a shame you have to use the word &#x2018;natural&#x2019; in front of &#x2018;horsemanship.&#x2019; It should all be natural, the way you interact with a horse, the way you converse, teach and perform together in this incredible partnership. In my day, they called it, &#x2018;It&#x2019; and it was a kind of secret society because people were ridiculed for taking the time to understand the way horses think and learn, rather than just showing the horse who&#x2019;s boss. Today, it is becoming more the way, to train horses using love, language, and leadership; using psychology rather than mechanics no matter what your discipline, from recreational to performance.</p><p>"This is not horsemanship versus eventing; it is about laying a proper foundation before specialization. To see Tik Maynard bridging these two worlds in his quest to become a real horseman will inspire generations to come and contribute to making a better world for horses and the people who love them." <b>Pat Parelli,</b> Bestselling Author, Founder of Parelli Natural Horsemanship�</p><p></p><p> </p><p>"Tik Maynard is not only a fantastic writer but a special horseman. His ability to work naturally through a horse&#x2019;s problems and to communicate what he does in a way people can understand is a gift. He has a never-ending want for knowledge about horses, and I hope he continues to share his experiences." <b>Lauren Bliss Kieffer</b>, US Olympian</p><p> </p><p>"Tik Maynard&#x2019;s writing is engaging and insightful. With each turn of the page I felt like I was right there, rooting with him through the triumphs and challenges of his horsemanship adventure. Loved the gems that came from his experiences and the honesty he shares. Anyone who loves horses and is passionate about becoming better with them will love this book!" <b>Jonathan Field</b>, Horseman, Author of <i>The Art of Liberty Training for Horses</i></p><p> "About five years ago, I met Tik Maynard for the first time when he attended a clinic I was giving in Maryland. I immediately observed: Tik is a special person, who has an equally good understanding for both people and horses. Tik can put himself in his partner&#x2019;s place and listens closely to the horse that has offered Tik his trust.</p><p> "Tik possesses the knowledge of both classical riding and natural horsemanship that is necessary to bring them together. Bringing together these two complementary approaches has helped him become a true horseman. He has traveled a rough road. But, he never gave up. Over time, he was able to convert every discouragement, every rejection, into something positive. He&#x2019;s tried to learn as much as he can from each of his trainers. That still applies to Tik today and is the basis for this exciting book.</p><p> "What can the reader gain from this book? You should never give up and always keep your specific goal in sight&#x2015;and you must do that in the face of all the adversities that a rider must overcome in the course of his education. In this regard, Tik is a role model for all of his readers." <b>Christoph Hess</b>, FEI Dressage and Eventing Judge and Ambassador for Training and Education of the German National Equestrian Federation (FN)</p><p></p><p> </p><p>"As with horses and life, actions speak much louder and mean more than words. I think this statement is true for horses and people: Horses don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Tik Maynard should be proud to count himself as one of those people. I am happy and humbled to have played a small part in his horsemanship and life's journey." <b>Bruce Logan</b>, Clinician and Horse Specialist</p><p> </p><p>"Tik Maynard writes like a seasoned novelist but there is no mistaking the authenticity of his story. Whether you&#x2019;re crazy about horses or not, you&#x2019;ll enjoy this ride." <b>Rick Lamb</b>, Co-Author of <i>A Revolution in Horsemanship</i> and Author of <i>Human to Horseman</i></p><p> </p><p>"Tik Maynard arrived at my barn like an energetic young dressage prospect with plenty of cadence in his step and a joy that filled the arena. I knew this was going to be fun! With his unparalleled desire to learn everything he possibly could I was hooked. Here was a student who was going to push me, and together we could both become better student and teacher understanding our horses more deeply and sharing thoughts and experiences in our blessed lives with our horses. This is who Tik is: engaging, inquisitive, intelligent, and compassionate about his horses and the work he does with them. It takes a great student to become a great teacher, and Tik is both. It was a great joy and pleasure to share time with him." <b>Betsy Steiner</b>, Dressage Trainer and Coach and Author of <i>A Gymnastic Riding System Using Mind, Body &amp; Spirit</i></p><p> </p><p>"People have a hard time being aware. Awareness of their environment, of other people, of what effects their actions have on others, animal or human. Self-awareness is even more rare. This is a book about self-awareness. How does one learn? How does one process the world? Observation is a necessity to be successful in an animal world. How one processes one&#x2019;s own observations is a key to being successful as a human being. Tik Maynard has opened up and shown his ability to be self-aware and observational. This is an insightful book about the journey to acquire knowledge and then use that knowledge to help others, human and horse. It&#x2019;s a joy to read." <b>David O&#x2019;Connor</b>, F�d�ration �questre Internationale (FEI) Eventing Chair, Former Chef d&#x2019;Equipe US Eventing Team, Former President United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), Olympic Gold Medalist</p><p> </p><p>"In 1989 when I was 54 years old I started a Thoroughbred filly for the Queen of England. Upon Her Majesty&#x2019;s insistence that I write a book, I set out to write my autobiography, The Man Who Listens to Horses. Tik Maynard's book, like mine, is the tale of a young man committed to understanding horses and life.

This book is a collaboration between Wang Ju-Yi, one of modern China s most respected scholars, teachers, and practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, and his American apprentice and practitioner, Jason Robertson. While most textbooks focus either on the functions of the organs in basic physiology or on the uses of the channels in treatment, this book shows the essential relationships between the two. Theory and practice are connected through a detailed discussion of a channel palpation methodology developed by Dr. Wang, which leads to more precise and effective point selection, location, and technique. Applied Channel Theory in Chinese Medicine was developed during Mr. Robertson s apprenticeship with Dr. Wang in Beijing, and is presented in a unique and highly readable format that preserves the intimacy of dialogue between apprentice and teacher, with questions and answers, narratives, and case studies.</p><p>Wang Ju-Yi is a member of the first graduating class of the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (1962) and has practiced Chinese medicine for over 45 years. After three decades of seeing patients at the Xuan Wu Hospital of Chinese Medicine in Beijing, Dr. Wang retired to edit the prestigious journal Chinese Acupuncture. He has also been a pioneer in developing a private Chinese medical prac�tice in the quickly changing environment of modern Beijing. Jason D. Robertson is a graduate of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (San Francisco). He has lived and worked in China and Taiwan for over eight years. He studied Chinese language at Washington and Lee University, and then completed a post-graduate language program at Taiwan Normal University. Mr. Robertson currently maintains a private practice in Seattle, and is on the faculty of the Seattle Institute of Oriental Medicine.For those of you reading this text, I fervently hope that you will not become trapped in the surface of acupuncture therapy, striving only to learn experiential points from your teachers and colleagues. Bring the medicine to life by incorporating the system of channel theory, expand its applications, and innovate from a place of theoretical integrity. The field of acupuncture must continue to develop and expand, treating the new diseases of the modern era while always keeping a firm grasp on the basics. --Wang Ju-Yi, Preface</p><h2>Recovering Redemption Bible Study Book: How Christ Changes Everything</h2><p><i>Recovering Redemption Bible Study</i> guides you through the video teaching sessions from the <i>Recovering Redemption Leader Kit</i> and reinforces the powerful truths in Chandler's teaching.

Filled with profound guilt about his own crimes and disheartened by the chaos of the streets, Socrates calls together local people of all races and social stations and begins to conduct a Thinkers' Club, where all can discuss life's unanswerable questions.<p>Infiltrated by undercover cops and threatened by strain from within, the Thinkers' Club doesn't have it easy. But simply by debating racial authenticity, street justice, and the possibility of mutual understanding, Socrates and his unlikely crew actually begin to make a difference.</p><p><i>The Right Mistake</i> is Walter Mosley at his most incisive.

He lives in New York City.Starred Review. A history of terrible violence including rape and murder followed by 27 years of incarceration in a prison with its own codified violence have helped shape Socrates Fortlow, previously featured in two short story collections, <i>Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned</i> (1997) and <i>Walkin' the Dog</i> (1999). The hardened ex-con living in South Central L.A. has been chiseled by his experiences into a hulking essence of wise humanity. An initial gathering of diverse characters (a Muslim, a Jew, a Buddhist, a gambler, a singer, a lawyer, two killers, etc.) brought together by Socrates becomes an agent of change. The weekly Thinkers' Meetings grow despite internal dissension and attempts at suppression and subversion by authorities. The talks forge bonds, lead to actions, spread beyond L.A. and take on a life of their own. In the face of gangs, drugs, poverty and racism, Mosley poses the deceptively simple question&#x2014;What can I do?&#x2014;and provides a powerful and moving answer. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He spat a thin brown stream of chewing tobacco into an empty paint can, or maybe not that empty. Yellow paint, the yellow of egg yolks, now with a brown swirl in the middle: there&#x2019;s all kinds of beauty in life.<br> <br>&#x201c;You heard wrong,&#x201d; said Bernie.<br> <br>Uh-oh. Bernie was looking at Nixon in an irritated sort of way. Wasn&#x2019;t Nixon our buddy? True, Nixon&#x2019;s eyes were too close together, even for a human, but he was one of the best mechanics in the Valley according to Bernie, and if Bernie said so, then that was that, and besides, Nixon was also one of our top sources on the street, even though we once put him away for a year or so. Or maybe because of it! Anything&#x2019;s possible with perps, believe me. We&#x2019;ve taken down lots, me and my partner, Bernie. That&#x2019;s what we do at the Little Detective Agency. He&#x2019;s Bernie Little. I&#x2019;m Chet, pure and simple.<br> <br>Sidling on over toward Nixon, just in case backsliding was on his mind? The right move at a moment like this, no question, so I sidled, keeping my eyes on his hands the whole time. That&#x2019;s where the trouble usually comes from with humans; their feet are too slow to bother worrying about. Nixon&#x2019;s big hands&#x2014;fingers all oil-stained and as big as sausages&#x2014;were hanging by his sides, doing nothing much. I hadn&#x2019;t had a good sausage in ages, or even a bad one, not that there&#x2019;s such a thing as a bad sausage, and was trying my hardest to actually remember the last time, when I became aware that Bernie was speaking. When Bernie talks, I listen and listen hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . three sticks of dynamite, maybe four&#x2014;still waiting on forensics,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Somebody blew up the Porsche?&#x201d; said Nixon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kind of different from me driving it off a cliff,&#x201d; Bernie said, giving Nixon a hard stare. Loved seeing that hard stare of Bernie&#x2019;s: we&#x2019;ve made hay with it, let me tell you, although why anyone would want to is a bit of a puzzler, hay being nothing but dried-up grass, of no interest to me at all.<br> <br>Nixon nodded. &#x201c;No comparison.&#x201d; He spat another gob into the paint can; his aim was off the charts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is why,&#x201d; Bernie said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re in the market for a new one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A new old one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As old as the last one?&#x201d; said Nixon. &#x201c;Or a bit younger, like the one before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Depends,&#x201d; Bernie said, and he went on with a whole long depends thing which I missed&#x2014;on account of I&#x2019;d been listening too hard! How weird was that?<br> <br>The next thing I knew we were on our way to the yard at the back of Nixon&#x2019;s Championship Autobody. One of his guys was spray-painting a picture of a curvy woman on a black fender.<br> <br>&#x201c;More tit, Ruy,&#x201d; Nixon said as we went by. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ruy raised his mask. &#x201c;Sorry, boss.&#x201d;<br> <br>We kept going. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t get good help,&#x201d; Nixon said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going to happen to this country? We&#x2019;re competing in the global marketplace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe the big breast thing isn&#x2019;t as important overseas,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Talk sense, Bernie,&#x201d; Nixon said.<br> <br>We came to the back of the yard, all fenced in with barbed wire. This was a bad part of town: across the street, some dudes lounged around doing nothing special, never a good sign. Parked by the fence stood two wrecks, one rusted out, the other torched. I&#x2019;m not great with cars, but I know the shape of Porsches.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take your pick,&#x201d; said Nixon.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re paying me, right?&#x201d; said Bernie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Love your sense of humor,&#x201d; Nixon said. &#x201c;I was just mentioning it to the mayor, not two days ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re pals with the mayor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where do you think he gets the limo serviced?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you ask him how come he needs to ride around in that damn thing in the first place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; said Nixon. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the mayor, that&#x2019;s how come. And anyways I wasn&#x2019;t talkin&#x2019; to him directly. I was talkin&#x2019; to his security guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cal Luxton?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. He was the one who actually mentioned your name. But then the mayor slid down the window and we got to talkin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nixon shrugged. That&#x2019;s a human move I always watch for. It can mean lots of things. This time? Your call. &#x201c;Wanted to know if I was named after Nixon. You know&#x2014;the president.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;And are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your parents hated you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nixon gave Bernie a long look, a look I&#x2019;d seen many times. It meant someone had just realized that Bernie was the smartest human in the room, no news to me. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you know?&#x201d; Nixon said. &#x201c;I was the fifth boy. Long about then they were hankerin&#x2019; for a girl. But&#x2014;funny thing&#x2014;turns out to be a big plus with the mayor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Tricky Dick fan?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A secret fan,&#x201d; said Nixon. &#x201c;Just between him and me, what with the election coming up. On account of the name being so&#x2014;what would you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Toxic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, toxic with most people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can always change it,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; said Nixon. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of me.&#x201d; He took out his dip, bit off another chew. &#x201c;Maybe someday I&#x2019;ll invade Cambodia.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie laughed. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a look at these scrap heaps,&#x201d; he said, and then something else which I missed because of this growling I heard behind me. I turned and there was my old buddy Spike, the scariest junkyard dog I know, and I know plenty, amigo. Spike was part pit bull, part Rottweiler, part unknown, and we got along great: I have lots of unknown in me, too. We&#x2019;d had a nice tussle or two, me and Spike, including the night Bernie and I took Nixon down, something that maybe rubbed Spike the wrong way. What a barn burner! Although it was a gas station that ended up burning, but just as exciting, maybe more. And as for getting rubbed the wrong way? There&#x2019;s really no wrong way, in my opinion, only some that are better than others. I&#x2019;m not fussy.<br> <br>Spike lumbered up, gave me a bump. Just being friends: Spike was getting on now, that twisted warrior face almost completely white. I gave him a friendly bump back. He rose up and tried to . . . really? What a crazy idea! I shook him off, rose up myself, and tried to do the same crazy thing! What a time we were having! He shook me off and then we were racing around the yard&#x2014;not really racing, since Spike was no speedster&#x2014;nipping at each other and barking our heads off. Did we roll around some in an oily patch? Maybe, but I couldn&#x2019;t be sure, because all of a sudden Spike had one of those&#x2014;what were they called? welding torches?&#x2014;yes, welding torches in his mouth, and I had to have it, so&#x2014;<br> <br>FTWEEEEE!<br> <br>Spike and I pulled up, coming to a dead stop.<br> <br>FTWEEEEE!<br> <br>And glancing back, saw Nixon with his hand at his mouth, finger and thumb between his lips, and looking real mad for some reason. Oh, no. He was one of those humans who knew how to make that earsplitting whistle sound. Please, not again.<br> <br>FWTEEEEE!<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell gets into you?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>We were rolling in the van, this beat-up van we use for surveillance but was our only ride at the moment. I lay curled up on the shotgun seat, waiting for the pain in my ears to go away. What gets into me? Was that the question? I thought about it. Sometimes I think better with my eyes closed, so I closed them.<br> <br>When I awoke, I was back to feeling tip-top, so tip-top I knew I must have done some world-class thinking. I sat up straight, stuck my head out the window. Ah, the Valley. No place like it. The Valley goes on forever in all directions, and those smells! You haven&#x2019;t smelled till you&#x2019;ve smelled the Valley. Hot rubber, hot pavement, hot sauce, hot charcoal ash, hot everything! Yes, even hot ice cream. Plus all kinds of grease&#x2014;deep-fry grease, pizza grease, burrito grease, unwashed human skin grease, and human hair grease&#x2014;not to mention the grease on my tail at this very moment. Where had that come from? I tried to remember, but not hard. Back to the lovely smells of the Valley, all of them with something in common, namely the dry dusty scent of the desert. I wouldn&#x2019;t live anywhere else.<br> <br>Bernie glanced over at me. &#x201c;Smell anything, big guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>He stuck his own head out the window and took a few sniffs.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>That Bernie! The best human sense of humor in the business, bar none. This had to be one of his little jokes, what with the whole river of smells flowing by and us smack in the middle of it. A nice refreshing breeze sprang up behind me so I turned to check it out&#x2014;I can probably turn my head a bit farther around than you, no offense&#x2014;and there was my greasy tail, wagging away. I just love Bernie.<br> <br>We pulled into a strip mall. We&#x2019;ve got strip malls out the yingyang in the Valley, just one more thing that makes it great. This particular strip mall was where Suzie Sanchez worked. Suzie&#x2019;s a reporter for the Valley Tribune, and also Bernie&#x2019;s girlfriend. If he had to have a girlfriend, then Suzie was a great choice. Compared to Leda, for example, Bernie&#x2019;s ex-wife and mother of his kid, Charlie, who we miss a lot, seeing as he&#x2019;s only around some weekends, plus every second Christmas and Thanksgiving, a complicated human arrangement that turned out to mean having even less of Charlie. Thanksgiving&#x2019;s my favorite holiday and Halloween&#x2019;s the worst, but no time to get into that now.<br> <br>We entered the Tribune office, walking past the workstations, all empty, and there was Suzie at the back, fingers going tac-tac-tac on the keyboard, a sound I happened to like. If I had Suzie&#x2019;s job I&#x2019;d make that sound twenty-four seven, faster and faster, and with all my paws in action that would be pretty damn rapid. Kind of a strange thought; probably better if it never happens again.<br> <br>Some humans have the sort of brain where you can feel it at work, like a powerful, pulsing muscle. Suzie was one of those, but at the same time, she had a big warm smile and black eyes that shone like the countertops in our kitchen after Bernie polishes them, which doesn&#x2019;t happen often. Only when we got real close did she look up.<br> <br>Then came a surprise. Suzie wasn&#x2019;t smiling, and her eyes, shining for a moment, lost that sparkle almost right away.<br> <br>Bernie was smiling, though, that real big one, always so nice to see.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Suzie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Lookin&#x2019; good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Liar,&#x201d; she said, sweeping back a lock of her dark hair. Hey! What was that? A line on Suzie&#x2019;s forehead? And another? Those were new, unless my memory was playing tricks on me, something memories can do, Bernie says, although I don&#x2019;t remember ever experiencing that personally.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d the car thing go?&#x201d; Suzie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Found a beauty,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>We had? News to me, but I got most of my news from Bernie.<br> <br>Suzie pressed a button and her screen went dark. &#x201c;Bernie?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Got a moment?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More than a moment. How about we take you to lunch?&#x201d;<br> <br>Suzie bit her lip, another one of those human things I look for. In the nation within the nation, as Bernie sometimes calls me and my kind, we don&#x2019;t bite our lips, except by accident, when a bit of lip gets caught on a tooth, say. Human lip biting sends a message, a message I&#x2019;d never gotten from Suzie before.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m slammed today, Bernie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just go out for a little walk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A walk? It&#x2019;s ninety-seven out there and just getting started.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A short walk.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie&#x2019;s smile faded and was gone. &#x201c;Something on your mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>Suzie nodded, her eyes not meeting his. I got a sudden urge to chew on something; almost anything would do.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can talk here,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>Suzie glanced around. Still just us in the office, but she said, &#x201c;Outside&#x2019;s better.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okeydoke,&#x201d; said Bernie. Okeydoke is a way Bernie has of saying yes, but only when we&#x2019;re on the job, so what was up with that?<br> <br>We went outside. There was some confusion at the door, but I ended up going out first. We walked toward a line of skinny, dusty trees that separated this strip mall from the next one. An old picnic table, weathered and lopsided, stood in the shade.<br> <br>With picnic tables, it usually works like this: humans sit on the benches, facing the table, and I settle down underneath, waiting to get lucky, picnic food usually being pretty messy. But none of that happened now. No food, for one thing. Bernie sort of leaned against the table at a funny angle; Suzie sat at the end of one of the benches, but facing out, legs crossed and then uncrossed; I circled around. What was this? None of us could get comfortable? I started panting a bit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bernie?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have some news.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a newswoman.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suzie&#x2019;s lips turned upward in maybe the quickest, smallest smile I&#x2019;d ever seen. Then she nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a job offer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all?&#x201d; said Bernie.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought maybe you&#x2019;d met somebody.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Met somebody?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or Dylan was back in the picture.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dylan?&#x201d; Suzie said. &#x201c;Oh, Bernie.&#x201d; She held out her hand. Bernie took it in his.<br> <br>Dylan McKnight back in the picture? He was Suzie&#x2019;s boyfriend long ago, a perp who&#x2019;d done a stretch at Northern State Correctional, and was now where? LA? Hard to keep all the details straight, but the best one&#x2014;that time I&#x2019;d driven him up a tree&#x2014;was still so clear in my mind!<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me guess,&#x201d; said Bernie. &#x201c;The Trib&#x2019;s making you managing editor.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughed, one of those tiny laughs that&#x2019;s just a little jet of air from the nose. &#x201c;That would never happen,&#x201d; Suzie says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s another reporting job, but somewhere else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the Clarion?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>Suzie shook her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whew,&#x201d; said Bernie. &#x201c;Not sure how I&#x2019;d handle that. They won&#x2019;t stop until every square inch of the whole state&#x2019;s totally developed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Post, Bernie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie has very expressive eyebrows, one of his best features, although they&#x2019;re all so good, it&#x2019;s hard to choose. Right now, his eyebrows were sort of trying to meet in the middle, a puzzled look you didn&#x2019;t often see on Bernie&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;The Post?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Washington Post,&#x201d; said Suzie.<br> <br>Bernie let go of Suzie&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Something was up&#x2014;I could just tell. But what?<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so torn,&#x201d; Suzie said. &#x201c;And the irony is it&#x2019;s all due to that series I wrote about the Big Bear case.&#x201d;<br> <br>Whoa. Big Bear Wilderness Camp? The sheriff? Those deputies? That judge? The mama bear? All of them breaking rocks in the hot sun by now, or very soon. Except for that mama bear, of course. Let&#x2019;s not get started on her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be torn,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;You deserve it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no deserving, Bernie. Not in this business.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; He went silent.<br> <br>&#x201c;But what?&#x201d; said Suzie.<br> <br>Bernie took a deep breath. &#x201c;Could you turn it down, walk away, and then never think about it again? The what-ifs, what-might-have-beens, all that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Suzie went quiet. Then she took a deep breath, too. &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Bernie&#x2019;s lips moved, just the slightest, like he was about to say something, but he did not.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been checking flights,&#x201d; Suzie said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re cheap if you book far enough in advance. Weekends would be way more doable than you&#x2019;d think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; said Bernie, his voice getting kind of thick in a strange way, like there was something in his throat, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s all good.&#x201d;<br> <br>What was this? I&#x2019;d been gnawing away at one of the legs of the picnic table? And it didn&#x2019;t even feel that great? Not bad, exactly, just more like . ...</p><h2>Nonprofit Sustainability: Making Strategic Decisions for Financial Viability</h2><p><b>Praise for NONPROFIT SUSTAINABILITY</b> <p>"This is much more than a financial how-to book.

I was then a child of but five years, yet I will remember the tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.<br> <br>He seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of the children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or he would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with stories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world. We all loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.<br> <br>He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over six feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the trained fighting man. His features were regular and clear cut, his hair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray, reflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire and initiative. His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that of a typical southern gentleman of the highest type.<br> <br>His horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delight even in that country of magnificent horsemen. I have often heard my father caution him against his wild recklessness but he would only laugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back of a horse yet unfoaled.<br> <br>When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some fifteen or sixteen years. When he returned it was without warning, and I was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment, nor had he changed in any other outward way. He was, when others were with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into space, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery; and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I did not know until I read his manuscript years afterwards.<br> <br>He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part of the time since the war; and that he had been very successful was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied. As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent, in fact he would not talk of them at all.<br> <br>He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, where he purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once a year on the occasions of my trips to the New York market&#x2014;my father and I owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia at that time. Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage, situated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my last visits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied in writing, I presume now, upon this manuscript.<br> <br>He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity.<br> <br>After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the Hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal. I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never had understood that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.<br> <br>Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to come to him at once. I had always been his favorite among the younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.<br> <br>I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on the morning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive me out to Captain Carter&#x2019;s he replied that if I was a friend of the Captain&#x2019;s he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been found dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached to an adjoining property.<br> <br>For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his place as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the body and of his affairs.<br> <br>I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local police chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study. The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the body, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it. It lay, he said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched above the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen him on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the skies.<br> <br>There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a local physician the coroner&#x2019;s jury quickly reached a decision of death from heart failure. Left alone in the study, I opened the safe and withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would find my instructions. They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have followed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.<br> <br>He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated. The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.<br> <br>His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire income for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine. His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to retain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor was I to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.<br> <br>A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that the massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated spring lock which can be opened <i>only from the inside</i>.<br> <br>Yours very sincerely,<br> <br>Edgar Rice Burroughs<br> <br>� 2012 Simon &amp; Schuster</p><h2>A Puritan Theology: Doctrine for Life</h2><p><i>A Puritan Theology: Doctrine for Life</i> offers a groundbreaking treatment of the Puritans teaching on most major Reformed doctrines, particularly those doctrines in which the Puritans made significant contributions. Since the late 1950s, nearly 150 Puritan authors and 700 Puritan titles have been reprinted and catalogued by Joel Beeke and Randall Pederson in their 2006 collection of mini-biographies and book reviews, titled, <i>Meet the Puritans</i>. However, no work until now has gathered together the threads of their teaching into a unified tapestry of systematic theology.<p> <i>A Puritan Theology</i>, by Joel Beeke and Mark Jones, attempts to do that. The book addresses Puritan teachings on all six loci of theology, covering fifty areas of doctrine. The book explores Puritan teachings on biblical interpretation, God, predestination, providence, angels, sin, the covenants, the gospel, Christ, preparation for conversion, regeneration, coming to Christ, justification, adoption, church government, the Sabbath, preaching, baptism, heaven, hell, and many other topics. It ends with eight chapters that explore Puritan theology in practice. Some chapters highlight the work of a specific theologian such as William Perkins, William Ames, John Owen, Stephen Charnock, or Thomas Goodwin on a specific topic. Other chapters survey various authors on a particular subject. The goal of <i>A Puritan Theology</i> is to increase knowledge in the mind and godliness in the soul. It was written for theologians, historians, pastors, and educated laymen who seek to learn more about Puritan theology.</p><p><br> <b>Contents: </b><br> Prolegomena<br> Theology Proper<br> Anthropology and Covenant Theology<br> Christology<br> Soteriology<br> Ecclesiology<br> Eschatology<br> Theology in Practice<br></p></p><p>Joel R.

What were their views on conscience and Christ's intercession for us? In <i>A Puritan Theology</i> compiled by Dr. Joel R. Beeke and Mark Jones, we have the answers to these and many other questions. In this unique one volume work we have a robust systematic theology drawn from the teachings of the most beloved Puritans an outstanding achievement indeed!

Her low silhouette stood black and ominous against the backdrop of the trees along the shoreline. Shadowy, phantom-like images of men moved across her decks under the eerie yellow glow of lanterns as moisture trickled down her gray, sloping sides and dripped into the sluggish current of the James River. </p><p> The <i>Texas</i> tugged at her dockside mooring line as impatiently as a hound about to be unleashed for the hunt. Thick iron shutters covered her gun-ports and the 6-inch armor on her casemate showed no markings. Only a white and red battle ensign atop the mast behind her smokestack, hanging limp in the damp atmosphere, signified her as a warship of the Confederate States Navy. </p><p> To landsmen she looked squat and ugly, but to sailors there was a character and grace about her that was unmistakable. She was tough, and she was deadly, the last of her peculiar design that set sail on a cruise to extinction after a brief but enduring burst of glory. </p><p> Commander Mason Tombs stood on the forward deck, pulled a blue bandana from a pocket, and dabbed at the dampness that seeped inside the collar of his uniform. The loading was going slow, too slow. The <i>Texas</i> would need every minute of available darkness for her escape to the open sea. He watched anxiously as his crew swore and strained while they manhandled wooden crates across a gangplank and down an open hatch on the deck. The crates seemed unusually heavy for containing the written records of the four-year-old government. They came from mule-drawn wagons deployed near the dock that were strongly guarded by the battle-weary survivors of a Georgia infantry company. </p><p> Tombs turned an uneasy eye toward Richmond, only 2 miles to the north. Grant had broken Lee's stubborn defense of Petersburg, and now the battered army of the South was retreating toward Appomattox and abandoning the Confederate capital to the advancing Union forces. The evacuation was underway and the city was filled with confusion as riots and pillaging swept the streets. Explosions shook the ground and flames burst into the night as warehouses and arsenals filled with supplies of war were put to the torch. </p><p> Tombs was ambitious and energetic, one of the finest naval officers in the Confederacy. He was a short, handsome-faced man with brown hair and eyebrows, a thick red beard, and a flinty look in his olive black eyes. </p><p> Commander of small gunboats at the battles of New Orleans and Memphis, gunnery officer on board the fighting ironclad <i>Arkansas,</i> and first officer of the infamous sea raider <i>Florida,</i> Tombs had proven a dangerous man for the Union cause. He had assumed command of the <i>Texas</i> only a week after she was completed at the Rocketts naval yard in Richmond, having demanded and supervised a number of modifications in preparation for an almost impossible voyage downriver past a thousand Union guns. </p><p> He turned his attention back to the cargo loading as the last wagon pulled away from the dock and disappeared into the night. He slipped his watch from a pocket, opened the lid, and held up the face toward a lantern that hung on a dock piling. </p><p> It read eight-twenty. Little more than eight hours left before daylight. Not enough time to run the last 20 miles of the gauntlet under the cloak of darkness. </p><p> An open carriage pulled by a team of dappled horses rolled up and stopped beside the dock. The driver sat stiffly without turning as the two passengers watched the final few crates being lowered through the hatch. The heavier man in civilian clothes slouched tiredly while the other, who was wearing an officer's naval uniform, spied Tombs and waved. </p><p> Tombs stepped across the plank onto the dock, approached the carriage, and saluted smartly. "An honor, Admiral, Mr. Secretary. I didn't think either of you would have time for a farewell." </p><p> Admiral Raphael Semmes, famed for his exploits as captain of the Confederate sea wolf, <i>Alabama, </i>and now commander of the James River squadron of ironclad gunboats, nodded and smiled through a heavily waxed moustache and a small goatee protruding beneath his lower lip. "A regiment of Yankees couldn't have kept me from seeing you off." </p><p> Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Confederate States Navy, stretched out a hand. "Too much is riding on you for us not to take the time to wish you luck." </p><p> "I've a stout ship and a brave crew," said Tombs with confidence. "We'll break through." </p><p> Semmes' smile faded and his eyes filled with foreboding. "If you find it impossible, you must burn and scuttle the ship in the deepest part of the river so that our archives can never be salvaged by the Union." </p><p> "The charges are in place and primed," Tombs assured Semmes. "The bottom hull will be blown away, dropping the weighted crates in the river mud while the ship continues a safe distance away under full steam before sinking." </p><p> Mallory nodded. "A sound plan." </p><p> The two men in the carriage exchanged strange knowing looks. An awkward moment passed. Then Semmes said, "I'm sorry to lay another burden on your shoulders at the last moment, but you will also be responsible for a passenger." </p><p> "Passenger?" Tombs repeated grimly. "No one who values his life I trust." </p><p> "He has no choice in the matter," Mallory muttered. </p><p> "Where is he?" Tombs demanded, gazing around the dock. "We're almost ready to cast off." </p><p> "He will arrive shortly," replied Semmes. </p><p> "May I ask who <i>he</i> is?" </p><p> "You will recognize him easily enough," said Mallory. "And pray the enemy also identifies him should you need to put him on display." </p><p> "I don't understand." </p><p> Mallory smiled for the first time. "You will, my boy, you will." </p><p> "A piece of information you may find useful," said Semmes, changing the subject. "My spies report that our former ironclad ram, the <i>Atlanta,</i> captured last year by Yankee monitors, has been pressed into service by the Union navy and is patrolling the river above Newport News." </p><p> Tombs brightened. "Yes, I see. Since the <i>Texas</i> has the same general shape and approximate dimensions she could be mistaken for the <i>Atlanta</i> in the dark." </p><p> Semmes nodded and handed him a folded flag. "The stars and stripes. You'll need it for the masquerade." </p><p> Tombs took the Union banner and held it under one arm. "I'll have it run up the mast shortly before we reach the Union artillery emplacements at Trent's Reach." </p><p> "Then good luck to you," said Semmes. "Sorry we can't stay to see you cast off, but the Secretary has a train to catch and I have to return to the fleet and oversee its destruction before the Yankees are upon us." </p><p> The Secretary of the Confederate navy shook Tombs' hand once more. "The blockade runner <i>Fox</i> is standing by off Bermuda to recoal your bunkers for the next leg of your voyage. Good fortune to you, Commander. The salvation of the Confederacy is in your hands." </p><p> Before Tombs could reply, Mallory ordered the carriage driver to move on. Tombs raised his hand in a final salute and stood there, his mind failing to comprehend the Secretary's farewell. Salvation of the Confederacy? The words made no sense. The war was lost. With Sherman moving north from the Carolinas and Grant surging south through Virginia like a tidal wave, Lee would be caught between the Union pincers and forced to surrender in a matter of days. Jefferson Davis would soon be broken from President of the Confederate States to a common fugitive. </p><p> And within a few short hours, the <i>Texas</i> had every expectation of being the last ship of the Confederate navy to die a watery death. </p><p> Where was the salvation should the <i>Texas</i> make good her escape? Tombs failed to fathom a vague answer. His orders were to transport the government's archives to a neutral port of his choosing and remain out of sight until contacted by courier. How could the successful smuggling of bureaucratic records possibly prevent the certain defeat of the South? </p><p> His thoughts were interrupted by his first officer, Lieutenant Ezra Craven. </p><p> "The loading is completed and the cargo stored, sir," announced Craven. "Shall I give the order to cast off?" </p><p> Tombs turned. "Not yet. We have to take on a passenger." </p><p> Craven, a big brusque Scotsman, spoke with a peculiar combination of brogue and southern drawl. "He'd better make it damned quick." </p><p> "Is Chief Engineer O'Hare ready to get underway?" </p><p> "His engines have a full head of steam." </p><p> "And the gun crews?" </p><p> "Manning their stations." </p><p> "We'll stay buttoned up until we meet the Federal fleet. We can't afford to lose a gun and crew from a lucky shot through a port beforehand." </p><p> "The men won't take kindly to turning the other cheek." </p><p> "Tell them they'll live longer -- " </p><p> Both men swung and stared toward the shore at the sound of approaching hooves. A few seconds later a Confederate officer rode out of the darkness and onto the dock. </p><p> "One of you Commander Tombs?" he asked in a tired voice. </p><p> "I'm Tombs," he said, stepping forward. </p><p> The rider swung down from his horse and saluted. He was covered with road dust and looked exhausted. "My compliments, sir. Captain Neville Brown, in charge of the escort for your prisoner." </p><p> "Prisoner," Tombs echoed. "I was told he was a passenger." </p><p> "Treat him as you will," Brown shrugged indifferently. </p><p> "Where is he?" Tombs asked for the second time that night. </p><p> "Immediately behind. I rode out in advance of my party to warn you not to be alarmed." </p><p> "Is the man daft?" muttered Craven. "Alarmed at what?" </p><p> His question was answered as a closed coach rumbled onto the dock surrounded by a detachment of riders dressed in the blue uniform of Union cavalry. </p><p> Tombs was on the verge of shouting for his crew to run out the guns and repel boarders when Captain Brown calmly reassured him. "Rest easy, Commander. They're good southern boys.

While some deaths make headlines, most are personal tragedies suffered within families and communities. Worse, these killings are done one person at a time, so as not to raise alarm. While it is much more difficult to justify killing many people at once, in dramatic fashion, the result is the same&#x2014;genocide.</p><p>Taking on such high-profile cases as Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and a host of others, Crump witnessed the disparities within the American legal system firsthand and learned it is dangerous to be a black man in America&#x2014;and that the justice system indeed only protects wealthy white men.</p><p>In this enlightening and enthralling work, he shows that there is a persistent, prevailing, and destructive mindset regarding colored people that is rooted in our history as a slaveowning nation. This biased attitude has given rise to mass incarceration, voter disenfranchisement, unequal educational opportunities, disparate health care practices, job and housing discrimination, police brutality, and an unequal justice system. And all mask the silent and ongoing systematic killing of people of color. </p><p><em>Open Season</em> is more than Crump&#x2019;s incredible mission to preserve justice, it is a call to action for Americans to begin living up to the promise to protect the rights of its citizens equally and without question.</p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>Through a steadfast dedication to justice and service, renowned civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump has established himself as one of the nation&#x2019;s foremost lawyers and advocates for social justice.

Lucko</p><h2>Magpie Murders</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2017:</strong> When editor Susan Ryeland begins to read the latest manuscript by curmudgeonly, bestselling author Alan Conway, she has no idea that by the time she gets to the end, the author will be dead from a mysterious fall, and that the last chapter of his last novel will be MIA. Sounds simple enough, but Horowitz uses this set-up to construct a clever novel-within-a-novel framework. One novel is set in 1950s Saxby-on-Avon, the English village where Conway&#x2019;s Poirot-like fictional detective Atticus Pund arrives to investigate a murder, the other in modern-day London where Susan&#x2019;s reading of the manuscript leads her to suspect that Conway&#x2019;s death may not have been accidental. Two novels for the price of one means double the fun for readers: two mysteries, two detectives, and possibly two murderers. Paying homage to the vintage British manor house mysteries, Magpie Murders is a masterfully dark, twisty thriller with only one down side: reading it will make you wish there really was a series of Atticus Pund thrillers. <em>--Vannessa Cronin, The Amazon Book Review</em><p>From the author of <em>Moriarty</em> and <em>Trigger Mortis</em>, this fiendishly brilliant, riveting thriller interweaves a classic whodunit worthy of Agatha Christie with an equally ingenious modern-day mystery that transforms the reader into the detective.</p><p>Alan Conway is a bestselling crime writer. His editor, Susan Ryeland, has worked with him for years, and she&#x2019;s intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus P�nd, who solves mysteries disturbing sleepy English villages. Alan&#x2019;s traditional formula pays homage to queens of classic British crime such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. It has proved hugely successful. <em>So</em> successful that Susan must continue to put up with his troubling behaviour if she wants to keep her job.</p><p>When Susan receives Alan&#x2019;s latest manuscript, in which Atticus P�nd investigates a murder at Pye Hall, an English manor house, she has no reason to think it will be any different from the others. There will be dead bodies, a cast of intriguing suspects and plenty of red herrings and clues. But the more Susan reads, the more she realises that there&#x2019;s another story hidden in the pages of the manuscript&#x2014;one of ambition, jealousy and greed&#x2014;and that soon it will lead to murder.</p><p>Deviously dark, clever and ruthlessly suspenseful, <em>Magpie Murders</em> is a masterful dark take on vintage crime fiction.</p></p><h2>SPIDER-MAN: SPIDER-VERSE - MILES MORALES (Spider-man, 1)</h2><p>Get to know Miles Morales, the Spider-Man of two worlds!

The disorder usually presents in children before the age of five, but it may not be recognized until the child starts school. When requested to speak, children with selective mutism often look down, blush, or otherwise express anxiety that disrupts their engagement with people and activities. Selective mutism is related to social anxiety and social phobia, and more than 90 percent of children with selective mutism also manifest symptoms of one of these problems.</p> <p>This book is the first available for parents of children with selective mutism. It offers a broad overview of the condition and reviews the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The book details a plan you can use to coordinate professional treatment of your child's disorder. It also explains the steps you can take on your own to encourage your child to speak comfortably in school and in his or her peer group. All of the book's strategies employ a gradual, "stepladder" approach. The techniques gently encourage children to speak more, while at the same time helping them feel safe and supported.</p> <p>Angela E.

Their meet-cute is more of a meet-fail, but soon Annie finds herself sharing some classic rom-com moments with Drew. Her Tom Hanks can&#x2019;t be an actor who&#x2019;s leaving town in a matter of days...can he?</p><p><b>Kerry Winfrey</b> is the author of <i>Love and Other Alien Experiences</i> and <i>Things Jolie Needs to Do Before She Bites It</i>.

After all, he&#x2019;s married to Rita Wilson, and I&#x2019;m not the sort of monster who would want to break up what is perhaps Hollywood&#x2019;s one truly perfect union. And anyway, I&#x2019;m twenty-seven, so he&#x2019;s a little bit old for me (no offense if you&#x2019;re reading this, Tom).</p><p>The Tom Hanks I thought I&#x2019;d meet is the Tom Hanks of romantic comedies. The Tom Hanks who starred in Nora Ephron films. The one who wrote about bouquets of sharpened pencils or told radio call-in show hosts how much he missed his wife. The one who lived on an unbelievably luxurious houseboat or called Meg Ryan &#x201c;shopgirl.&#x201d; The man with a heart of gold, the one I was meant to be with even if we lived on opposite coasts or owned competing bookstores.</p><p>I should have run into him by now, while I&#x2019;m carrying a large, unwieldy stack of books and he&#x2019;s hurrying to some important business meeting. Or maybe I should have tripped over my own feet and fallen right into his arms (note to self: start wearing more impractical footwear). Or maybe I should&#x2019;ve bumped into him while Christmas shopping, when both of us spotted the very last fancy scarf and we each desperately needed to buy it for our own fancy-scarf-wearing relatives. And we would fight and get angry and hurl insults that neither of us really meant, but that underlying passion would translate into some fantastic flirty banter, and then that scarf would get written into our wedding vows in a hilarious-yet-touching surprise that wouldn&#x2019;t leave a dry eye in the house.</p><p>Not that I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this, or anything.</p><p>It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of romantic comedies, and I can&#x2019;t even blame that on Tom Hanks himself, as much as I would like to pin all of my problems on a celebrity.</p><p>No, I blame my mother.</p><p>She&#x2019;s the one who indoctrinated me into the Cult of Ephron, the one who showed me When Harry Met Sally&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when I was only nine years old and way, way too young to understand what Sally was imitating in that deli scene. She&#x2019;s the one who spent Saturday nights sobbing over the end of Sleepless in Seattle, showing me that true love sometimes involved a little bit of light stalking and a lot of encouragement from Rosie O&#x2019;Donnell. She&#x2019;s the one who introduced me to the charms of Rock Hudson and Doris Day sharing a phone line and being incredibly deceptive in Pillow Talk.</p><p>And yes, only one of those films actually stars Tom Hanks, but that&#x2019;s not the point. Tom Hanks isn&#x2019;t a person so much as he is a representation of the kind of man I deserve, as my mom told me over and over. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t settle for someone who doesn&#x2019;t adore you,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;My favorite thing about your dad was that he worshipped the ground I walked on.&#x201d;</p><p>She was kidding, but only sort of. Anyone who saw a picture of my dad and mom together would know that they were one of those golden couples, the ones who get together and stay together and end up like those old people talking to the camera in When Harry Met Sally&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about how they met. And they would&#x2019;ve been, if he hadn&#x2019;t died when I was just a baby, before I even got a chance to remember him.</p><p>My mom died much later, of a heart attack. I have a theory that you can react to tragedy in one of two ways: you either distract yourself from your pain with over-activity, or you make yourself a home inside your pain cocoon. In high school and college, my coping strategy was the former. Instead of thinking about how much I missed my mom, which could easily have been a 24/7 extracurricular, I threw myself into activities, clubs, and projects. I was valedictorian in high school and graduated summa cum laude in college with a degree in film studies. I studied movies, watched approximately one million of them, and dreamed of someday writing my own Nora Ephron style romantic comedy.</p><p>But after college, after I was done crossing off every item on my to-do list, my over-activity ground to a halt. I couldn&#x2019;t bear to leave my childhood home, which my uncle Don moved into after my mom&#x2019;s death so I wouldn&#x2019;t have to change schools. I didn&#x2019;t have anything to do after I hung my graduation robe up in the closet, but I knew one thing: Tom Hanks would be able to solve this.</p><p>Again, not Tom Hanks himself, although he does seem like a very smart man, and I&#x2019;m sure that if he can write a short-story collection or direct the film That Thing You Do! then he could probably figure out a way to fix my life. But in most romantic comedies, the female lead is floundering. Maybe she&#x2019;s adrift, maybe she&#x2019;s lonely, maybe she&#x2019;s a workaholic who needs to learn how to love! But no matter what, she has some sort of dream she&#x2019;s working toward, and she just can&#x2019;t figure out how to get there. But then she meets him&#x2014;Tom Hanks or Rock Hudson or the rapper Common in the way underrated basketball rom-com Just Wright&#x2014;and it all clicks into place. She figures it out. She gets stronger and smarter and she achieves her dreams, plus she finds love.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m starting to think that the movies I&#x2019;ve dedicated my life to may have lied to me. Nora Ephron herself may have indirectly lied to me. Tom Hanks, as much as I&#x2019;ve trusted him, may have lied to me.</p><p>Because I have it all: the sympathetic backstory, the montage of humiliations minor and major, unrealized career aspirations, the untamed pre-makeover hair. But still, I wait. Single, lonely, Hanksless.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t help but think that a large part of my current state of Hanklessness is due to the fact that I&#x2019;m a twenty-seven-year-old woman who shares a Victorian house with her uncle.</p><p>I let myself into the house as quietly as I can, slipping off my boots to avoid tracking slush through the house. It&#x2019;s the middle of January, and the Columbus snow long ago ceased to be the sparkling, magical holiday treat it is in so many Hallmark Christmas movies. Now it&#x2019;s just gray and gross, and it&#x2019;s depressing to look at it and know there are months left of this. Ohio winters are an endurance test, not necessarily in how much snow you can handle, but in how many gray, sunless days you can take before you flee to a warmer climate.</p><p>I hang up my coat and try to creep through the living room and upstairs without being noticed, but then I hear Uncle Don&#x2019;s voice ring out. &#x201c;Annie!&#x201d;</p><p>I turn to my right, where four fifty-something men are crowded around our dining room table.</p><p>I wave and step into the dining room, which is lined with dark wainscoting and the same red floral wallpaper my mom installed when I was a baby. &#x201c;Hey, guys.&#x201d;</p><p>This is Uncle Don&#x2019;s Dungeons and Dragons group. Every Thursday night they meet to&#x2014;well, honestly, I&#x2019;m not 100 percent sure what the game entails. I hear snippets&#x2014;stuff about orcs and werewolves and ice lords&#x2014;but personally, I wouldn&#x2019;t know a wizard from a warlock, so I figure this is Uncle Don&#x2019;s version of book club and try to stay out of it. Mostly I think it&#x2019;s kind of sweet that these four men have been getting together almost every week for going on twenty years. And other than his part-time job at the gaming store, The Guardtower, Uncle Don doesn&#x2019;t really get out much, so it&#x2019;s nice that he has some built-in socialization.</p><p>&#x201c;How was the library, sweet pea?&#x201d; Uncle Don asks, ignoring the glare from his friend Rick. Rick is the Dungeon Master, aka the boss of the game, which you would know if you saw the shirt he wears every Thursday that proclaims, &#x201c;When the Dungeon Master smiles, it&#x2019;s already too late.&#x201d; I have no idea what this means, but since Dungeon Master Rick hates distractions, I&#x2019;ve never asked for an explanation.</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I got a lot done.&#x201d;</p><p>Even though I&#x2019;ve been attempting to write my own rom-com for years, right now I&#x2019;m working as a freelance writer. Well, that makes it sound a little more glamorous than it is, seeing as I write &#x201c;web content&#x201d; with titles like, &#x201c;The Five BEST WAYS to Unclog a Toilet&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ten of Jennifer Lawrence&#x2019;s Hottest Hairdos!&#x201d; I may not be winning any awards anytime soon, but it pays (and you&#x2019;d be surprised how often you use that toilet unclogging advice when you live in a house with old pipes).</p><p>&#x201c;What did you write about today?&#x201d; asks Earl.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it Expired? What to Keep and What to Throw Out!&#x201d; I say with wide eyes and jazz hands, trying to mimic the excitement of the headline.</p><p>&#x201c;Did I ever tell you guys,&#x201d; Paul says, wiping his glasses on his shirt, &#x201c;About that time I accidentally ate a yogurt that expired in 2007?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ugh!&#x201d; I say as Don asks, &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>Paul shrugs, putting his glasses back on. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m still here, aren&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But he did throw up for the better part of three days,&#x201d; says Paul&#x2019;s husband, Earl, who rounds out their gaming foursome. The two of them met through D&amp;D, which would be a great meet-cute for a rom-com if I knew enough about D&amp;D to write it.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; says Dungeon Master Rick. &#x201c;But unless the evil gnome that&#x2019;s currently trapping your party in a cave can be vanquished by dairy, I don&#x2019;t really want to discuss yogurt right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, fine, fine,&#x201d; Paul says. &#x201c;See you later, Annie.&#x201d;</p><p>Uncle Don waves, rolling his eyes at Dungeon Master Rick, who&#x2019;s already describing the various gnome inventions scattered throughout the cave.</p><p>I smile and head upstairs to my room, the same one I&#x2019;ve had since I was a child. Although it&#x2019;s changed a little&#x2014;now I have soft pink walls instead of kitten wallpaper, and framed photos of my parents (and, okay, one of Nora Ephron, too) instead of posters of whatever guy I thought was cute at the time. But other than that, it&#x2019;s pretty much the same. My twin bed, my refinished antique desk, the green glass lamp that used to belong to my grandma.</p><p>In other words, this isn&#x2019;t the kind of bedroom you can bring a man back to. Other than the regrettable sex I had with my high school boyfriend right after my mom died in the hopes that it would make me feel better (spoiler alert: it did not!), I&#x2019;ve never even had sex in this room. I mean, how would that even work? Would I introduce a dude to all of the D&amp;D guys, then excuse us with a line like, &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m going upstairs to try to bone this guy as quietly as possible, but everything in this house squeaks because it&#x2019;s a million years old, so sorry, I guess!&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t even know how a full-size man would fit into that twin bed; his feet would probably hang off the end.</p><p>But I haven&#x2019;t done anything to change my situation, and that&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m still waiting for Tom Hanks. And sure, he hasn&#x2019;t found me yet, but it&#x2019;s okay, because I&#x2019;m just at the beginning of my rom-com, the part with a montage that demonstrates how sad, lonely, and down-on-her-luck our leading lady is.</p><p>My Tom Hanks is out there, and I&#x2019;m not going to settle until I find him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying you have to settle,&#x201d; my best friend Chloe says as she sits down across from me at the wobbly table. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying you should give some of these guys a chance.&#x201d;</p><p>Nick&#x2019;s coffee shop is the perfect place to get some writing done. It&#x2019;s within walking distance of my house, there are plenty of outlets to plug in my laptop, and the ambient noise of people talking and cups clinking is the perfect soundtrack for working. I guess what I&#x2019;m saying is that it would be the perfect place to work if Chloe wasn&#x2019;t a barista there and we didn&#x2019;t spend most of my work time talking.</p><p>Well, she calls herself a barista. Nick Velez, the owner, simply refers to her as an &#x201c;employee&#x201d; because words like &#x201c;barista&#x201d; and &#x201c;latte art&#x201d; make him cringe. Nick&#x2019;s other employee, Tobin, is a college student who rarely, if ever, shows up on time and usually drops more cups than he serves, but he has a good heart, and Nick keeps him around, despite always threatening to fire him.</p><p>&#x201c;I give every guy I go out with a chance,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;But last guy I went out with smelled like Funyuns.&#x201d;</p><p>Chloe wrinkles her nose. &#x201c;You mean onions?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;That would&#x2019;ve been better. He smelled specifically like the snack food Funyuns.&#x201d;</p><p>Chloe rolls her eyes. &#x201c;Okay, well, what about that guy?&#x201d;</p><p>She points to a dude in his late twenties wearing headphones and sitting at a table in the corner. I shake my head.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with him?&#x201d; she asks, exasperated. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s cute!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;First off, he doesn&#x2019;t give off &#x2018;lives on a houseboat with his young son&#x2019; vibes,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And secondly, he&#x2019;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sitting there. Big deal.&#x201d;</p><p>Chloe stares blankly at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the intrigue? The mystery? The part where we&#x2019;re secretly pen pals but also own rival businesses?&#x201d;</p><p>Chloe shakes her head. &#x201c;I always think you&#x2019;re exaggerating, but you&#x2019;re literally in love with a fictional man. You know those movies aren&#x2019;t real, right? They&#x2019;re made up! I&#x2019;ve watched about ten thousand more rom-coms than I ever wanted to see because of you, and I can definitely say that they&#x2019;re all bullshit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They aren&#x2019;t!&#x201d; I start to protest, but Chloe cuts me off.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not trying to insult them, because I know you love them and I&#x2019;m sure the rom-com you write is going to be a cinematic masterpiece, but you can&#x2019;t live your life by their rules. I mean, I don&#x2019;t let what I watch affect my life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you mostly watch documentaries about murder,&#x201d; I point out.</p><p>&#x201c;True. And I guess I have changed a lot of my actions. I don&#x2019;t wear a ponytail anymore, that&#x2019;s for sure. Makes it easier for some guy to yank it and pull you into a darkened alley,&#x201d; she says, pulling a pretend ponytail.</p><p>&#x201c;Just because I&#x2019;m looking for what I know I deserve doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m being unrealistic,&#x201d; I say primly, as if this is all a joke for me, but really it isn&#x2019;t. I have so little of my mom, but this&#x2014;her movies, her insistence that I not settle&#x2014;is what I remember.</p><p>&#x201c;Join the rest of us here on planet Earth,&#x201d; Chloe whispers, grabbing my hands. &#x201c;We get free drinks from men and enjoy commitment-less sex. It&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in meaningless sex,&#x201d; I say, trying to focus on my laptop. &#x201c;I want a connection.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Re-download Tinder and I can help you find a connection,&#x201d; Chloe says, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hearing this,&#x201d; Nick says from behind the counter, turning on the espresso machine.</p><p>&#x201c;Nick,&#x201d; Chloe says with a sugary-sweet smile as soon as the machine shuts off. &#x201c;Have you given any more thought to my suggestion?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean your suggestion that I change the name of my place?&#x201d; Nick asks, rubbing one hand over the brown scruff on his chin. Nick&#x2019;s in his early thirties, lanky, and one of those guys whose face is covered in a perpetual five o&#x2019;clock shadow, even at ten in the morning. &#x201c;Nick&#x2019;s my name. I own the shop. It makes sense.&#x201d;</p><p>Chloe sighs in exasperation, pursing her pink-glossed lips. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you ever heard of puns, Nick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hate puns,&#x201d; Nick says, handing the espresso to a regular customer named Gary, an older guy who always wears a beat-up Ohio State baseball cap.</p><p>&#x201c;The Daily Grind! Thanks a Latte!&#x201d; Chloe shouts.</p><p>&#x201c;Brewed Awakening,&#x201d; says Tobin. Nick shoots him a dirty look.</p><p>&#x201c;Pizza My Heart,&#x201d; Gary says as he takes a seat, and we all turn to look...</p></p><h2>Compassion and Self Hate: An Alternative to Despair</h2><p>Free yourself from destructive behavior and learn how to break your patterns of self-hate and achieve personal fulfillment with this sympathetic and practical guide from the author of <i>The Angry Book</i>.<br><br>Many of us know that self-destructive patterns are rooted in self-dislike, but few of us understand how to break them.

This may be one of the strangest.<br><br>A legendary charter captain and guide named Tootsie Barlow has come to him, muttering about a curse. The members of his extended family have suffered a bizarre series of attacks, and Barlow is convinced it has something to do with a multiple murder in 1925, in which his family had a shameful part.<br><br>Ford doesn't believe in curses, but as he and his friend Tomlinson begin to investigate, following the trail of the attacks from Key Largo to Tallahassee, they, too, suffer a series of near-fatal mishaps. Is it really a curse? Or just a crime spree? The answer lies in solving a near-hundred-year-old murder...and probing the mind of a madman.</p><p><b>Randy Wayne White</b>&nbsp;is the author of the Doc Ford novels, the Hannah Smith novels, and four collections of nonfiction. He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years, and spends much of his free time windsurfing, playing baseball, and hanging out at Doc Ford's Rum Bar &amp; Grille.1<br><br> On the phone, Tomlinson said to Ford, "When the deputy's wife and kids disappeared, moonshiners might've dumped their bodies in the lake-it was during Prohibition. It wouldn't be the first time karma has waited decades to boot justice in the ass."<br><br> "Tootsie Barlow told you that story?" Ford, a marine biologist, was referring to a famous fishing guide who ranked with Jimmie Albright, Jack Brothers, Ted Williams, and a few others as fly-casting pioneers in the Florida Keys.<br><br> "His family was involved somehow-the Barlows go way, way back in the area. I don't know how yet, but I will. He's in bad shape, so I need to take it slow, but you're the one who told me about the lake-Chino Hole. That's the connection. The access road cuts through Tootsie's property."<br><br> "I had no idea. He moved to the Everglades?"<br><br> "Smack-dab in the middle. One of those little crossroads villages like Copeland or Carnestown. The property's been in his family for years. I'm driving down this afternoon. Since he quit guiding, it's probably easier for him to wake up and see sawgrass instead of the Gulf Stream. The endgame, dude, for watermen like us, it can be pretty damn sad."<br><br> "I've heard the rumor," Ford said. "As far as your story goes, I'm still lost."<br><br> "So's Tootsie. How many fishing guides put away money for retirement? He's broke, which is bad enough, but now he's afraid that God has singled out his family for punishment. Like a conspiracy, you know? Not because of something he did, more likely something his father or a relative did. The cops won't listen, his preacher doesn't believe him, so who else is he gonna call but the Right Reverend, yours truly."<br><br> Tomlinson, an ordained Rinzai Buddhist priest, seldom employed the honorific "Right Reverend." The title had been bestowed by a Las Vegas divinity mill after cashing his check for fifty bucks.<br><br> "Tootsie wants you to put in a good word with God, I get it. I still don't see what this has to do with us . . ."<br><br> "He wants someone to convince the cops he's not crazy. And there's another connection. The deputy who disappeared was J. H. Cox. That ring a bell? It should."<br><br> "When was this?"<br><br> "Nineteen twenty-five. A few years earlier, a woman was murdered by a man named Cox. Same area; near Marco Island. I don't know if it was the same man, but your Hannah Smith is a direct descendant of the woman he killed."<br><br> Mentioning the biologist's ex-lover, Hannah, was a calculated risk to catalyze Ford's interest. In the background over the phone, Tomlinson could hear a steel drum band. "Hey, seriously, where are you?"<br><br> Ford, who was in the lobby of the Schooner Hotel, Nassau, Bahamas, said, "I'm in Lauderdale. At a convention for aquarium hobbyists. I'll get back to the lab late tomorrow. Hopefully."<br><br> "Bahia Mar, Lauderdale?"<br><br> "Close enough. Look . . . I've got a talk to give and I'm still working on my notes." As he spoke, the child-porn dealer he'd been tailing stepped to the registration desk. Ford covered the phone and moved as if getting into line.<br><br> When he rejoined the conversation, his boat bum hipster pal Tomlinson was saying, ". . . Tootsie's story is historical fact. I've got the old newspaper stories to prove it. In August 1925, Deputy Cox, his wife, and two kids all disappeared the night before a bunch of bootleggers went on trial. Marco Island or somewhere at the edge of the Everglades-get it?-all within a few miles of Chino Hole."<br><br> "Moonshiners would need fresh water," Ford reasoned while he watched the clerk encode the porn dealer's room key.<br><br> "That's who the newspapers blamed, but there was other nasty crap going on at the time, which I'm just starting to research. You ever hear of the Marco Island war?"<br><br> "Come on, you're making this up."<br><br> "It happened, man. Same time period. A bunch of heavy hitters had their fingers in the regional pie-Al Capone, probably Joe Kennedy, too, but they weren't the worst. The elite rich were stealing homesteads, and smuggling in Chinese illegals to boot." Tomlinson sniffed, and added, "Lauderdale, huh? Dude, the satellite must'a stopped over Nassau, 'cause I swear can I smell jerked chicken."<br><br> Ford replied, "Call you back," and hung up as the clerk addressed the porn dealer by name for the third time-standard, in the hospitality business-then handed over a key in a sleeve with the number 803 written on it and circled.<br><br> "I'll be checking out in about an hour," Ford told the clerk when it was his turn.<br><br> There were ceiling fans in the lobby and panoramic windows, beyond which sunbaked tourists lounged by the pool. A brunette in a red handkerchief two-piece was sufficiently lush and languid to spark a yearning in the biologist-an abdominal pang he recognized as discontent.<br><br> Focus, he told himself, and returned to his encrypted notes. It became easier when the brunette stood and buttoned up her beach wrap. Every set of poolside eyes followed her to the door.<br><br> An hour later, the porn dealer reappeared in the lobby, wearing shorts and flip-flops, and exited toward the tiki bar.<br><br> Ford shouldered his computer bag, and crossed the lobby to the elevators.<br><br> From the eighth floor, Montagu Bay was a turquoise basin encrusted with slums and ox cart traffic on the eastern fringe. Spaced along the waterfront were resort compounds; postcard enclaves that were separated from Nassau's realities by armed guards and tastefully disguised concertina wire.<br><br> The biologist no longer wondered why tourists came to places like this. People seldom traveled. Not really. Travel was too damn unpredictable. Instead, they contrived daydreams. They chose template fictions that matched, or came close enough to, the vacation they wanted to describe to their friends back home.<br><br> Near the elevator was a house phone. He dialed housekeeping, and told the woman, "I'm a dope. Can you please send someone up with a key to eight-oh-three? I locked myself out."<br><br> "Your name, sir?"<br><br> "James Lutz." That was the name the porn dealer was using.<br><br> "When security arrives," the woman added, "show them your passport, Mr. Lutz."<br><br> "Have him bring a bucket of ice, too," the biologist replied.<br><br> He was palming a twenty-euro bill when a kid wearing a name badge appeared, used a passkey, and bowed him into the room. "Hang on, I've got something for you." Inside the closet, as anticipated, was a wall safe, which he fiddled with before giving up. "Damn . . . must have punched in the number wrong. What's the default code? I need my wallet."<br><br> The kid opened the safe, and stepped back in deference to this solid-looking American who exuded confidence, but in a friendly way that suggested he was also generous.<br><br> "Thank you, Mr. Lutz," the kid said, accepting the twenty. No eye contact; he backed out of the room.<br><br> "You're supposed to see this." The fake passport earned only a dutiful glance.<br><br> He has no future in the security trade, Ford rationalized when the kid was gone. I did him a favor.<br><br> On the other hand, probably not. Child pornography was a billion-dollar international industry. Nassau was the ancillary stronghold for a Russian network that branched into Haiti, Indonesia, and the Middle East, particularly Muslim regions where daughters were treated as chattel. Children provided a steady income to jihadists who enjoyed beheading infidels. When word got out that a low-level dealer had lost incriminating files while drinking at the pool bar, Jimmy Lutz, or whatever his name was, would beg first for his life, then a painless bullet.<br><br> If he lived that long.<br><br> Wearing gloves and a jeweler's eyepiece, Ford secured an adhesive keystroke transmitter to Lutz's laptop. The translucent tape was two inches long and thinner than a human hair. Once mounted on the screen's black border, it became invisible, which Ford confirmed, before returning the laptop to its case.<br><br> Next, the safe. He photographed the contents: a wallet, two passports, a bundle of cash, and half a dozen ultra-secure biometric thumb drives. Three platinum thumb drives, three stealth black. Ford's employer, a Swiss agency, had anticipated this, but had provided him with only four stealth versions. He switched out the three black thumb drives, and repositioned each exactly as he'd found it before closing the safe.<br><br> Ford had also anticipated that Jimmy Lutz was in Nassau on a working vacation. On the bed, a Dacor dive bag lay next to a leather suitcase and a valet parking ticket. He unzipped the bag and removed a buoyancy compensator vest attached to a four-hose regulator.<br><br> The gear looked new.<br><br> Using a multi-tool, he popped a pin, removed the regulator's cover; next, a lubricating seal and the main diaphragm. A stainless valve seat and plunger were cupped within. With a drop of water-soluble glue, he seated an object that would clog the system when it broke free but would dissolve without a trace within twenty minutes. He did the same to the backup regulator, then returned everything to the bag.<br><br> There was no such thing as a zero signature robbery unless the victim wasn't alive to report the crime. No guarantees when or if it would happen, but a nice touch if the man had booked an afternoon dive.<br><br> When Ford was done, he consulted photos of the room to be sure it was exactly as he'd found it, then cracked the door and eyeballed the hallway.<br><br> Damn it . . . Lumbering toward him was Jimmy Lutz after only twenty minutes at the tiki bar. Maybe he'd left his wallet, or needed cigars. Ford hurried past the bed, pocketed the valet ticket, then exited onto the balcony, closing the curtains and sliding doors.<br><br> "You . . . bastard . . . get your hands off me," a woman said from nearby. British accent. She sounded more startled than mad. A neighboring balcony was empty, but billowing curtains suggested the woman was in the adjoining suite. Ford's attention wavered until a slamming door told him Lutz was in the room. Lights came on within, then heavy feet flip-flopped toward him, as the woman, voice louder, threatened, "I'll call the police, by god, if you don't get out of here right now."<br><br> Lutz heard her; curtains parted. Ford hugged the wall while the man peered out, his face inches away through the glass. Satisfied the woman wasn't on his balcony, Lutz engaged the dead bolt and swept the curtains closed.<br><br> Ford was trapped. He waited, hearing a mix of sounds from the adjoining suite: a clatter of furniture; the woman gasping, "Damn you . . . that hurts," and other indecipherable noises that signaled a struggle. Or was it a kinky twosome enjoying rough love?<br><br> Inside Lutz's room, a toilet flushed. A door suctioned curtains, then banged closed.<br><br> The porn dealer was gone.<br><br> Ford grabbed his tactical bag before testing the sliding doors. Yes, they were locked. He swung a leg over the railing, ignored the dizzying distance to the beach below, and made the long step to the next balcony, which was screened by landscape foliage. A potted plant crashed to the tile when he pushed his bag through, then followed. Beyond billowing curtains, through open doors, the room went silent.<br><br> Standing, looking in, he was prepared to apologize to the couple until he accessed the scene. A fit man wearing medical whites and a name badge glared back-a massage therapist whose table had collapsed on the floor during a struggle. Askew on the table, still battling to cover her body with a sheet, was the brunette he'd seen by the pool.<br><br> "Didn't know you was there, sir," the man glowered. "She want to call the constables, fine, but what you think they'll say? She's the one requested MY services."<br><br> In Nassau, even extortion threats sounded as melodic as a woodwind flute.<br><br> "Are you hurt?" Ford asked the woman. He pushed the curtains aside and stepped in.<br><br> She was confused, and mad enough to sputter, "I want this bastard fired. If you work for the hotel, I want to file a-"<br><br> "That man don't work here," the therapist said. Until then, he'd been backing toward the door. Now, looking from Ford to the broken pottery outside, he figured out the situation. "Yeah, what the police gonna say? This guest hire me, take her clothes off, her own free accord. I already know who they gonna believe."<br><br> "You cheeky son of a bitch." The woman tried to scoot away; the sheet fell. She folded her arms to cover herself until Ford yanked the sheet free and tossed it over her. He wore a baggy white guayabera shirt, tails out to cover the waistband of his khaki slacks. Again he asked the woman if she was hurt.<br><br> "Who are you?" she demanded. "For Christ's sake, call the manager . . . or do something. This man tried to rape me."<br><br> "Naw, come on," the therapist said in a soothing way. "That ain't true. You want to know the real problem? This fella come here to rob you, that's what they'll figure out. Why else he climb over that balcony? You being such a wealthy lady, they'll know a poor boy like me wouldn't do nothing so stupid."<br><br> "Bastard," the woman said, while the man grinned.<br><br> "Ain't you the spicy one," he countered. "I'm not the type to make trouble, so tell you what. Mister, I'm willing to leave polite-like-but I want compensation for all the fun I missed, plus the coin you lost me. Sound fair?"<br><br> "Very fair," Ford said. He reached back as if for a billfold but came up with a 9mm pistol and leveled the sights at the man's nose.<br><br> "Where do you want it?" he asked.<br><br> The massage therapist, no longer smiling, said, "Shit, man. What the . . . Don't make me take that away from you, 'cause you won't like what happens next."<br><br> Staring over the sights, Ford cocked the pistol, and spoke to the woman: "Get some clothes on and call the police, if that's what you want. But not from here. There's a house phone near the elevators."<br><br> The therapist turned to her. "See there, Miz Cobourg! He plans to shoot me 'cause he don't want witnesses," while the woman asked Ford, "Is it true? The constables won't believe me?"<br><br> "Not a chance," Ford said. "You made the appointment through the concierge?"<br><br> "Of course," she said, then understood the implications. "Oh hell. Yes, it was a damn fool thing to do, I suppose." She got to her feet with the sheet around her, no longer afraid, just angry and undecided.<br><br> "It happens a lot in places like this. If you're worried about headlines, I'd pack your things now and not look back. Or just forget it."</p><h2>Arifureta: From Commonplace to World&#39;s Strongest (Light Novel) Vol. 3</h2><p><p><b>LET&#x2019;S GET TO IT, THEN!</b></p><p>After clearing the Reisen Labyrinth, Hajime, Yue and Shea make for the independent city-state of Fuhren, where they get roped into helping the adventurer&#x2019;s guild look for a missing person, leading to an unexpected reunion with someone Hajime thought he&#x2019;d never see again.

An American author of Korean descent living in London, she grew up in a large ex-pat community of women who came of age in postwar South Korea. In 2002, Bracht visited her mother's childhood village, and it was during this trip she first learned of the "comfort women." <i>White Chrysanthemum</i> is her first novel.Hana <br><p><i>Jeju Island, Summer 1943</i></p><p>Hana is sixteen and knows nothing but a life lived under occupation. Japan annexed Korea in 1910, and Hana speaks fluent Japanese, is educated in Japanese history and culture, and is prohibited from speaking, reading, or writing in her native Korean. She is a second-class citizen with second-class rights in her own country, but that does not diminish her Korean pride. Hana and her mother are <i>haenyeo</i>, women of the sea, and they work for themselves. They live in a tiny village on Jeju Island&#x2019;s southern coast and dive in a cove hidden from the main road that leads into town. Hana&#x2019;s father is a fisherman. He navigates the South Sea with the other village men, evading imperial fishing boats that loot Korea&#x2019;s coastal waters for produce to repatriate back to Japan. Hana and her mother only interact with Japanese soldiers when they go to market to sell their day&#x2019;s catch. It creates a sense of freedom not many on the other side of the island, or even on mainland Korea, a hundred miles to the north, enjoy. The occupation is a taboo topic, especially at market; only the brave dare to broach it, and even then only in whispers and behind cupped hands. The villagers are tired of the heavy taxes, the forced <i>donations</i> to the war effort, and the taking of men to fight on the front lines and children to work in factories in Japan.</p><p>On Hana&#x2019;s island, diving is women&#x2019;s work. Their bodies suit the cold depths of the ocean better than men&#x2019;s. They can hold their breath longer, swim deeper, and keep their body temperature warmer, so for centuries,&nbsp;Jeju women have enjoyed a rare independence. Hana followed her mother into the sea at an early age. Learning to swim began the moment she could lift her head on her own, though she was nearly eleven the first time her mother took her into the deeper waters and showed her how to cut an abalone from a rock on the seafloor. In her excitement, Hana lost her breath sooner than expected and had to race upward for air. Her lungs burned. When she finally broke the surface, she breathed in more water than oxygen. Sputtering with her chin barely above the waves, she was disoriented and began to panic. A sudden swell rolled over her, submerging her in an instant. She swallowed more water as her head dipped beneath the surface.</p><p>With one hand, her mother lifted Hana&#x2019;s face above the water. Hana gulped in air between racking coughs. Her nose and throat burned. Her mother&#x2019;s hand, secured at the nape of her neck, reassured her until she recovered.</p><p>&#x201c;Always look to the shore when you rise, or you can lose your way,&#x201d; her mother said, and turned Hana to face the land. There on the sand, her younger sister sat protecting the buckets containing the day&#x2019;s catch. &#x201c;Look for your sister after each dive. Never forget. If you see her, you are safe.&#x201d;</p><p>When Hana&#x2019;s breaths had returned to normal, her mother released her and commenced diving with a slow forward somersault down into the ocean&#x2019;s depths. Hana watched her sister a few moments longer, taking in the serene sight of her resting on the beach, waiting for her family to return from the sea. Fully recovered, Hana swam to the buoy and added her abalone to her mother&#x2019;s catch, which was stowed safely in a net. Then she performed her own somersault, down into the ocean&#x2019;s thrumming interior, in search of another sea creature to add to their harvest.</p><p>Her sister was too young to dive with them when they were that far from the shore. Sometimes, when Hana surfaced, she would look first to the shore to find her sister chasing after seagulls, waving sticks wildly in the air. She was like a butterfly dancing across Hana&#x2019;s sightline.</p><p>Hana was already seven years old when her sister was finally born. She had worried she would be an only child her whole life. She had wished for a younger sibling for so long&#x2014;all of her friends had two, three, or sometimes even four brothers and sisters to play with each day and to share the burden of household chores, while she had to suffer everything alone. But then her mother became pregnant, and Hana swelled with such hope that she beamed each time she caught a glimpse of her mother&#x2019;s growing stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re much fatter today, aren&#x2019;t you, Mother?&#x201d; she asked the morning of her sister&#x2019;s birth.</p><p>&#x201c;Very, very fat and uncomfortable!&#x201d; her mother replied, and tickled Hana&#x2019;s taut stomach.</p><p>She tumbled onto her back and giggled with delight. Once she caught her breath, Hana sat beside her mother and placed a hand on the outermost curve of her bulging stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;My sister or brother must be nearly done, right, Mother?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nearly done? You speak as though I&#x2019;m boiling rice inside my belly, silly girl!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not rice, my new sister&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or brother,&#x201d; Hana added quickly, and felt a timid kick against her hand. &#x201c;When will she, or he, come out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Such an impatient daughter sits before me.&#x201d; Her mother shook her head in resignation. &#x201c;Which would you prefer, a sister or a brother?&#x201d;</p><p>Hana knew the correct answer was a brother, so that her father would have a son to share his fishing knowledge with, but in her head she answered differently. <i>I hope you have a daughter, so that one day, she can swim in the sea with me.</i></p><p>Her mother went into labor that evening, and when they showed Hana her baby sister, she couldn&#x2019;t contain her happiness. She smiled the widest smile her face had ever known, yet tried with all her might to speak as though she was disappointed.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry that she is not a son, Mother, truly sorry,&#x201d; Hana said, shaking her head in mock sorrow.</p><p>Then Hana turned to her father and pulled his shirtsleeve. He leaned down, and she cupped her hands around his ear.</p><p>&#x201c;Father, I must confess something to you. I&#x2019;m very sorry for you, that she is not a son to learn your fishing skills, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She took a deep breath before finishing. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m so happy I have a sister to swim with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but don&#x2019;t tell Mother.&#x201d;</p><p>At seven years old, Hana was not skilled in the art of whispering, and gentle laughter rippled through the group of her parents&#x2019; closest friends. Hana grew quiet. Her ears burned. She hid behind her father and peeked at her mother from underneath his arm to see if she had also heard. Her mother gazed at her eldest daughter and then looked down at the hungry infant suckling her breast and whispered to her newest daughter, just loud enough for Hana to hear.</p><p>&#x201c;You are the most loved little sister in the whole of Jeju Island. Do you know that? No one will ever love you more than your big sister.&#x201d;</p><p>When she looked up at Hana, she motioned for her to come to her&nbsp;side. The adults in the room grew quiet as Hana knelt beside her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;You are her protector now, Hana,&#x201d; her mother said in a serious tone.</p><p>Hana gazed at her tiny baby sister. She reached out to caress the black tuft of hair sprouting from her scalp.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s so soft,&#x201d; Hana said with wonder.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear what I said? You are a big sister now, and with that comes responsibilities, and the first one is that of protector. I won&#x2019;t always be around; diving in the sea and selling at the market keeps us fed, and it will be left up to you to watch over your little sister from now on when I can&#x2019;t. Can I rely on you?&#x201d; her mother asked, her voice stern.</p><p>Hana&#x2019;s hand shot back to her side. She bowed her head and dutifully answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Mother, I will keep her safe. I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A promise is forever, Hana. Never forget.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will remember, Mother, always,&#x201d; Hana said, her eyes glued onto her little sister&#x2019;s peacefully dozing face. Milk dripped from the side of the baby&#x2019;s open mouth, and her mother wiped it with a swipe of her thumb.</p><p>As the years passed, and Hana began to dive with her mother in the deeper waters, she grew accustomed to seeing her sister in the distance, the girl who shared her blankets at night and whispered silly stories into the darkness, until she finally succumbed to sleep. The girl who laughed at everything and anything, a sound that made everyone nearby join in. She became Hana&#x2019;s anchor, to the shore and to life.</p><p>Hana knows that protecting her sister means keeping her away from Japanese soldiers. Her mother has drilled the lesson into her: <i>Never let them see you! And most of all, do not let yourself be caught alone with one!</i> Her mother&#x2019;s words of warning are filled with an ominous fear, and at sixteen Hana feels lucky this has never happened. But that changes on a hot summer day.</p><p>It is late in the afternoon, long after the other divers have gone to the market, when Hana first sees Corporal Morimoto. Her mother wanted to fill an extra net for a friend who was ill and couldn&#x2019;t dive that day. Her mother is always the first to offer help. Hana comes up for air and looks to the shore. Her sister is squatting on the sand, shading her eyes to look out toward Hana and their mother. At nine years of age, her sister is now old enough to stay on the shore alone but still too young to swim in the deeper waters with Hana and her mother. She is small for her age and not yet a strong swimmer.</p><p>Hana has just found a large conch and is ready to shout at her sister to express her joy, when she notices a man heading toward the beach. Treading water so that she can lift herself higher to see him more clearly, Hana realizes the man is a Japanese soldier. Her stomach knots into a sudden cramp. Why is he here? They never come this far from the villages. She scans the beach within the cove to see if there are more, but he&#x2019;s the only one. He is heading straight for her sister.</p><p>A ridge of rocks shields her sister from his view, but it won&#x2019;t do so for long. If he stays on his current path, he will stumble upon her, and then he will take her away&#x2014;ship her off to a factory in Japan like the other young girls who disappear from the villages. Her sister isn&#x2019;t strong enough to survive factory work or the brutal conditions they are subjected to. She is too young, and too loved, to be taken away.</p><p>Searching the horizon for her mother, Hana realizes she is down below, oblivious to the Japanese soldier heading toward the water&#x2019;s edge. She has no time to wait for her mother to resurface, and even if she did, her mother is too far away, hunting near the edge of the reef where it drops into a cavernous void with no seafloor in sight for miles. It is Hana&#x2019;s job to protect her little sister. She made a promise to her mother, and she intends to keep it.</p><p>Hana dives beneath the waves, swimming at full speed toward the beach. She can only hope to reach her sister before the soldier does. If she can distract him long enough, perhaps her sister can slip away and hide in the nearby cove, and then Hana can escape back into the ocean. Surely he wouldn&#x2019;t follow her into the water?</p><p>The current crushes against her as though desperate to push her back out to sea, toward safety. Panicking, she breaches the water&#x2019;s surface and takes in a deep breath, catching a glimpse of the soldier&#x2019;s progress. He is still headed for the rocky ledge.</p><p>She starts to swim above the waves, aware she is exposing herself but unable to bear staying too long beneath the water for fear of missing the soldier&#x2019;s advance. Hana is halfway to her sister when she sees him stop. He digs in his pocket for something. Plunging her head back into the water, she swims even faster. In her next breath, she sees him light a cigarette. With every subsequent breath, he moves just a little more. He blows out a puff of smoke, takes a drag, breathes it out, again and again with each lift of her head, until the last breath, when he looks toward the ocean and notices Hana&#x2019;s race toward him.</p><p>Only ten meters away from the shore, she hopes he can&#x2019;t see her little sister from where he stands. She is still hidden by the rocks, but not for long. Her small hands are on the stony sand, and she is beginning to push herself up to standing. Hana can&#x2019;t shout at her to stay down. She swims faster.</p><p>Hana pitches beneath the surface, pulling the water out of her way with each stroke, until her hands touch the sandy ground. Then she shoots to her feet and runs through the last few meters of shallow water. If he has called out to her as she runs toward the ledge, she can&#x2019;t hear him. Her heart thunders in her ears, blocking out all sound. It feels like she has traveled across half the earth in that sprint to the shore, but she can&#x2019;t stop yet. Her feet fly across the sand toward her sister, who is smiling at her in ignorance and preparing to greet Hana. Before her sister can speak, Hana lunges at her, seizing her shoulders and knocking her to the ground.</p><p>She covers her sister&#x2019;s mouth with her hand to keep her from crying out. When she sees Hana&#x2019;s face hovering above her, she knows better than to cry. Hana gives her a look only a little sister would understand. She pushes her sister into the sand, wishing she could bury her to hide her from the soldier&#x2019;s sight, but she has no time.</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you go?&#x201d; the soldier calls down to Hana. He is standing on a low rock ledge overlooking the beach. If he stands on the edge he could look down and see them both lying beneath him. &#x201c;Has the mermaid transformed into a girl?&#x201d;</p><p>His boots crunch on the stones above them. Her sister&#x2019;s trembling body feels fragile in Hana&#x2019;s hands. Her fear is contagious, and Hana, too, begins to tremble. She realizes there is nowhere for her sister to run. From his vantage point, he can see in every direction. They will both have to escape into the ocean, but her sister can&#x2019;t swim for very long. Hana can remain in the deep water for hours, but her little sister will drown if the soldier decides to wait them out. She has no plan. No escape. The realization sits heavy in her gut.</p><p>Slowly, she releases her sister&#x2019;s mouth and takes one last look into her frightened face before standing. His eyes are sharp, and she feels their piercing touch as they creep over her body.</p><p>&#x201c;Not a girl, but a grown woman,&#x201d; he says, and lets out a low, grumbling laugh.</p></p><h2>Ending Medical Reversal: Improving Outcomes, Saving Lives (Johns Hopkins Press Health Books (Paperback))</h2><p><p>Medications such as Vioxx and procedures such as vertebroplasty for back pain are among the medical "advances" that turned out to be dangerous or useless. What Dr. Vinayak K. Prasad and Dr. Adam S. Cifu call medical reversal happens when doctors start using a medication, procedure, or diagnostic tool without a robust evidence base&#x2015;and then stop using it when it is found not to help, or even to harm, patients.</p><p>In <i>Ending Medical Reversal</i>, Drs. Prasad and Cifu narrate fascinating stories from every corner of medicine to explore why medical reversals occur, how they are harmful, and what can be done to avoid them. They explore the difference between medical innovations that improve care and those that only appear to be promising. They also outline a comprehensive plan to reform medical education, research funding and protocols, and the process for approving new drugs that will ensure that more of what gets done in doctors' offices and hospitals is truly effective.</p></p><p><p>Why medicine adopts ineffective or harmful medical practices only to abandon them&#x2015;sometimes too late.</p><p><b>Vinayak K.

Among his string of highly successful restaurants in Oxford, Mississippi, Big Bad Breakfast holds a special place in diners' hearts: It is a gathering place where people from all walks come together to share the most important meal of the day, breakfast. Southerners know how to do breakfast right, and Currence has elevated it to an artform: dishes like Banana-Pecan Coffee Cake, Spicy Boudin and Poached Eggs, and Oyster Pot Pie are comforting, soulful, and packed with real Southern flavor. <i>Big Bad Breakfast</i> is full of delicious recipes that will make the day ahead that much better--not to mention stories of the wonderful characters who fill the restaurant every morning, and a meditation on why the Southern breakfast is one of America's most valuable culinary contributions.</p><p><b>John Currence </b>opened City Grocery in Oxford, Mississippi in 1992. Since then, the City Grocery Restaurant Group has opened a number of restaurants, including Ajax Diner, Nacho Mama&#x2019;s, Kalo&#x2019;s Tavern, Big Bad Breakfast, Bour�, Lamar Lounge, The Main Event, and Snackbar.

He is a contributing editor for <i>Garden &amp; Gun </i>magazine, a board member of No Kid Hungry (a project dedicated to eradicating childhood hunger in the United States), and an organizer and past board member of the prestigious annual Southern Foodways Symposium<b>.</b><b>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF BREAKFAST</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT EMBRACETH THE DAY. <br></b>First, accept that every day is new, fresh, and unique. Position yourself in the kitchen with an attitude that reflects your solemn purpose: you are about to prepare THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY, likely for someone you care for (otherwise you would not be up and at &#x2019;em at the stove).&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT HOLD NO MEAL HIGHER THAN BREAKFAST. <br></b>Commit to raising this disregarded meal from the depths of neglect to the place of honor it deserves. Pledge to put the same effort and passion into preparing breakfast as you would lunch or dinner. In other words, make something other than just a plate of eggs.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT GET THY MIND RIGHT. <br></b>This is fun, damn it. Plan ahead so you don&#x2019;t stress yourself out early in the morning: shop the day before, stock strong coffee, prep certain items in advance, and find some music that gets you going in the wee hours. All of these will make the chore at hand a little easier.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT SLATHER WITH BUTTER. <br></b>It will not kill you (consumed in quantities within reason, that is). Just let go for a few minutes and enjoy life a little. No fat tastes better on toast with jelly or when cooking eggs (bacon fat included).&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT ANOINTETH WITH BLACK PEPPER. <br></b>Whenever pepper is called for in an ingredients list, use freshly cracked black pepper. (The only exception is when I specifically call for white pepper.)&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT MAKE FROM SCRATCH. <br></b>It will certainly take more time and effort, but the essence of Big Bad Breakfast is scratch cooking. It&#x2019;s what made grandmother&#x2019;s cooking &#x201c;grandmother&#x2019;s cooking.&#x201d; As a matter of fact, I am certain that if my grandmothers and great-grandmothers had not succumbed to other, more natural afflictions, shame over what we accept as food these days would certainly have consumed each of them.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT USE RESTRAINT WITH INGREDIENTS. <br></b>Lots of folks get the wrong idea about recipes and lean toward &#x201c;the more flavors and ingredients I add, the more complex the end product.&#x201d; This could not be farther from the truth. The best cooking celebrates the elemental beauty of ingredients. You want to be able to taste everything in the dish, not create something that is just a muddle.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT SEEKETH LOCAL WHENEVER POSSIBLE. <br></b>Honey, eggs, grits, bacon, sausage, jellies, coffee, flour&#x2014;whatever it is, a local product is more often than not going to have a more singular character. Visit farmers&#x2019; markets, bake sales, local farms, and locally owned grocery stores.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT NOT OVERCOOK. <br></b>I am fascinated with the American worry about &#x201c;undercooking things.&#x201d; Food can always be cooked more if it is not cooked enough, but YOU CAN&#x2019;T FUCKING UNCOOK IT if you cook it too long. Granted, we shouldn&#x2019;t rub raw factory chicken on our toast right before we eat, but I have been making fresh mayonnaise and Caesar dressing with raw eggs for thirty-five years and nobody has ever been sick. Trichinosis is not carried by domestic pigs, and a piece of cooked pork that&#x2019;s still a little pink beats the crap out of a well-done, dried-out offering. Try the yolk runny, people. With a little salt, it transforms dishes from good to resplendent.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;<b>THOU SHALT REMEMBER THE SABBATH, BUT COOK FROM THIS BOOK EVERY DAY. <br></b>You can make pancakes for your kids, freeze them, and rewarm them later. You can make a breakfast casserole or assemble sweet rolls the night before and just turn on the oven the next day. Breakfast is a fun meal, and most of the time, it doesn&#x2019;t require a ton of effort or mess. More often than not, it&#x2019;s just about clearing your eyes and committing to loved ones. Remember, breakfast is a joy, not a chore, and the possibilities are endless. It just comes at a weird time of day. And if that&#x2019;s the deal breaker for you, well, shit, make breakfast for dinner.</p><h2>Engineering: An Illustrated History from Ancient Craft to Modern Technology (100 Ponderables)</h2><p><b>From ancient aqueducts to soaring skyscrapers, explore engineering milestones over the centuries.</b><p></p><p>Combining engaging text with captivating images and helpful diagrams, renowned science writer Tom Jackson guides readers through the history of Engineering in the 7th installment of the groundbreaking PonderablesTM series.</p><p>Engineering is all around us.

This crusade for the American wilderness was perhaps the greatest U.S. presidential initiative between the Civil War and World War I. Roosevelt&#x2019;s most important legacies led to the creation of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and passage of the Antiquities Act in 1906. His executive orders saved such treasures as Devils Tower, the Grand Canyon, and the Petrified Forest.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, August 2009:</strong> "The movement for the conversation of wild life and the larger movement for the conservation of all our natural resources are essentially democratic in spirit, purpose, and method." So wrote Theodore Roosevelt, known as the "naturalist President" for his efforts in protecting wildlife and wilderness, merging preservation and patriotism into a quintessential American ideal. The Wilderness Warrior, Douglas Brinkley's massive(ly readable) new biography, intrepidly explores the wilderness of influences (Audubon and Darwin), personal relationships (Muir and Pinchot), and frontier adventures (too many to mention) that shaped Roosevelt's proto-green views. Topping 800 pages (ironically, one wonders how many trees fell for the first printing), The Wilderness Warrior makes an excellent companion to Timothy Egan's <em>The Big Burn</em> and Ken Burns's <em>The National Parks: America's Best Idea</em>. <em>--Jon Foro</em><blockquote><p>One of the Best Books of the Year </p><p><em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Boston Globe</em>, <em>The Kansas City Star</em>, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>, and <em>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em></p></blockquote><p>In this monumental biography, acclaimed historian Douglas Brinkley examines the life and achievements of Theodore Roosevelt, our "naturalist president," and his tireless crusade for the American wilderness&#x2014;a legacy now more important than ever.</p></p><h2>The Quest for the Tree Kangaroo: An Expedition to the Cloud Forest of New Guinea (Scientists in the Field Series)</h2><p>It looks like a bear, but isn&#x2019;t one.

Sound strange? Well, not as strange as the superhero team fighting them. <br> &nbsp;<br> This exciting continuation from author Grant Morrison picks up in DOOM PATROL BOOK THREE, with art by Brian Bolland, Richard Case, Philip Bond, Ken Steacy, Sean Phillips and more. <br> &nbsp;<br> Collects DOOM PATROL #51-63 and the legendary DOOM FORCE SPECIAL #1.</p><p>Grant Morrison is known for his innovative work on comics, from the graphic novel ARKHAM ASYLUM to acclaimed runs on ANIMAL MAN and DOOM PATROL, as well as his subversive creator-owned titles such as THE INVISIBLES, SEAGUY, JOE THE BARBARIAN and WE3. He has also written best-selling runs on SUPERMAN: ACTION COMICS, BATMAN, INCORPORATED, JLA, SEVEN SOLDIERS OF VICTORY and&nbsp;<i>New X-Men</i>&nbsp;and helped to reinvent the DC Universe in ALL-STAR SUPERMAN, 52, BATMAN and JOE THE BARBARIAN.In the 1960s, the Doom Patrol was a -second-string superhero team whose freakish powers caused humanity to shun them (as it did their better-known contemporaries, Marvel's X-Men) and led to them being touted as "The World's Strangest Heroes." In the late 1980s, writer Morrison, recently noticed for drastically rejiggering another marginal sixties character, Animal Man, overhauled the Doom Patrol similarly, giving it a new cast far more deserving of the strangest-heroes mantle. Crazy Jane possesses 64 distinct personalities, each with its own superpower. Rebis is a bandaged hermaphrodite who encompasses a being made of negative energy. Ape-faced Dorothy Spinner can distort reality. The new villains were as outre. Here the DP faces the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E., dedicated to eliminating all eccentricities and anomalies. Another nemesis is Danny the Street, a sentient, transvestite street (no metaphor he) that moves about at will. During Morrison's run on <i>Doom Patrol</i>, plotlines generally took a backseat to outlandish concepts, and later issues bordered on incomprehensibility. This collection's contents, however, balance bizarreness and accessibility relatively well. <i>Gordon Flagg</i> <br> <i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In the Arctic, White shimmies under the ice with an Inuit elder to hunt for mussels in the dark cavities left behind at low tide; in China, he races the Silver Dragon, a twenty-five-foot tidal bore that crashes eighty miles up the Qiantang River; in France, he interviews the monks that live in the tide-wrapped monastery of Mont Saint-Michel; in Chile and Scotland, he investigates the growth of tidal power generation; and in Panama and Venice, he delves into how the threat of sea level rise is changing human culture the very old and very new. <i>Tides</i> combines lyrical prose, colorful adventure travel, and provocative scientific inquiry into the elemental, mysterious paradox that keeps our planet&#x2019;s waters in constant motion. Photographs, scientific figures, line drawings, and sixteen color photos dramatically illustrate this engaging, expert tour of the tides.</p><p><b>Jonathan White</b> is an active marine conservationist, a sailor, and a surfer.

Inspired by Plains Indian culture, he was best known for writing stories about Native Americans, including <i>The Legend of the White Buffalo Woman</i>,<i> The Return of the Buffaloes</i>, and the Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winning<i> The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses</i>.Gr. 4^-8. In this picture book for older readers, Goble uses his characteristic decorative paintings to help retell an important sacred legend of the Lakota people. He describes a great flood, which killed almost all life on the earth, and relates how the nation came to be born again from the union of a woman of the earth and an eagle of the sky. He then explains how the people came upon hard and frightening times and tells of the arrival of the powerful White Buffalo Woman, who gave the Lakota people the Sacred Calf Pipe, a gift of the Great Spirit. The use of boldface headings and the braiding together of several myths interrupt the flow of the text, leaving readers to pick up additional meaning from the illustrations, but Goble fans, young and old, will enjoy the details in the clothing and landscape. The cartoonlike battle scene, with bloody, rolling heads, will certainly attract the attention of some young readers. In addition to notes regarding the significance of the tale, how he determined the style of clothing, and why he utilized specific related myths in his retelling, Goble lists primary and secondary sources. Additional information about Indian pipes is appended, as is a map pinpointing Pipestone Quarry, now a national monument. <i>Karen Morgan</i></p><h2>The Irish Slaves: Slavery, indenture and Contract labor Among Irish Immigrants</h2><p>They came in the holds of overcrowded ships, packed in among cargo and animals. They were sold to others to work as hard and under as dismal conditions as their owners chose. They were taken to the West Indies, to Barbados, to the American colonies, and beyond. A familiar story, is it not? But these immigrants, derived of all personal freedom, were Irish, and their servitude started long before black slavery was common. Even among those not enslaved, many were treated nearly the same as indentured servants, or later as contract labor on the railroads, mines, and other dangerous tasks. Your eyes will be opened by this book if you dare to allow them to be, as you learn more of this nearly forgotten part of world history.

Critics contend that von Balthasar espouses universalism, the idea that all men will certainly be saved. Yet, as von Balthasar insists, damnation is a real possibility-for others but also for ourselves. Indeed, he explores the nature of damnation with sobering clarity. At the same time, he contends that a deep understanding of God's merciful love and human freedom, and a careful reading of the Catholic tradition, point to the possibility-not the certainty-that, in the end, all men will accept the salvation Christ won for all. For this all-embracing salvation, von Balthasar says, we may dare hope, we must pray, and with God's help we must work. </p> <p> The Catholic Church's teaching on Hell has been generally neglected by theologians, with the notable exception of von Balthasar. He grounds his reflections clearly in Sacred Scripture, and in Catholic teaching. While the Church asserts that certain individuals are in Heaven ("saints"), it never declares a specific individual to be in Hell. In fact, the Church hopes that in their final moments of life, even the greatest sinners would have repented of their terrible sins, and be saved. </p> <p> Sacred Scripture states, "God...desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and there is one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all." (1st Timothy, 2:4) </p></p><p><b>Hans Urs von Balthasar</b> (1905-1988) was a Swiss theologian widely regarded as one of the greatest theologians and spiritual writers of modern times. Named a cardinal by Pope John Paul II, he died shortly before being formally inducted into the College of Cardinals. He wrote over one hundred books, including <i>Prayer</i>, <i>Heart of the World</i>, <i>Love Alone is Credible</i>, and his major multi-volume theological work: <i>The Glory of the Lord</i>, <i>Theo-Drama</i>, and <i>Theo-Logic</i>."Truly deep theological questions can rarely be answered with a simple yes or no. Rather, they are approached by the careful theologian, who circles around them, making distinctions, bringing essential aspects to light. The issue of who and how many will be saved is surely one of the thorniest theological puzzles in the Catholic tradition, and I don't know any theologian-classical or contemporary-who performs the nimble task of bringing out the complexity and profiles of this issue better than Hans Urs von Balthasar. In this short but rich text, you will hear of grace, punishment, mercy, the awful self-absorption of sin-but above all of hope." --<strong>Fr. Robert Barron</strong>, Rector/President Mundelein Seminary/University of Saint Mary of the Lake</p><h2>Suzuki Cello School, Vol. 1 (Piano Accompaniment)</h2><p>Teach cello with the popular Suzuki Cello School.

Kelly's photos prove that this perspective--from 250 miles above earth--while hard-won, is also almost unspeakably beautiful. He mastered the rare art of microgravity photography. Using a Nikon D4 with a long 800mm lens and a 1.4x magnifying zoom lens, he panned the camera as the shutter released in order to compensate for the space station's velocity: 17,500 mph relative to the earth. Kelly's artist's eye helped make him a social media sensation, and here his photos are collected alongside his own commentary, which sets the images in their proper contexts, human and cosmic. Kelly captures sunsets, moonrises, the aurora borealis, and the luminous, hazy tapestry of the Milky Way. He presents snapshots of life and work on the International Space Station, from spacewalks to selfies. But above all--or floating amid all--he takes the earth itself as his celestial muse. Here are hurricanes, wrinkled mountains, New York City shining like a galaxy--glorious photographs that are, in themselves, a passionate argument for the preservation of our planet in the face of climate change and environmental destruction.</p><p>SCOTT KELLY is a former military fighter pilot and test pilot, an engineer, a retired astronaut, and a retired U.S. Navy captain.

My greatest hope is that the lessons the stories offer will help you make better choices than I did.&#34; Stanley &#34;Tookie&#34; Williams, cofounder of the notorious Crips gang, is a death-row inmate. But in his two decades of incarceration, Williams has also become a respected author and activist whose dedication to ending gang warfare in the lives of inner-city children has earned him a 2001 Nobel Peace Prize nomination. In this award-winning bookwhich has drawn praise from educators, government leaders, and families alikeWilliams describes the brutal reality of being an inmate. He debunks myths of prisons as &#34;gladiator schools&#34; with blunt, riveting stories of overwhelming homesickness, the terror of solitary confinement, and the humiliation of strip-searches. Williams&#39; words are a frank challenge to adolescent readers to educate themselves, make intelligent decisions, and above all, not to follow in his footsteps.</p><p>Stanley "Tookie" Williams was on death row at San Quentin State Prison from 1991 until his execution by lethal injection in December, 2005.<br><br>Barbara Cottman Becnel has been interviewing Stanley Williams since 1993 and has collaborated with him on his numerous anti-gang education projects. She lives in northern California.As a boy, Williams heard the older kids who'd served time tell stories that made prison sound glamorous and fun, a place to hang out with your friends and prove how tough you were. But now, after 16 years on San Quentin's death row for the murders of four people, Williams (Gangs and Violence), co-founder of the notorious Los Angeles Crips gang, knows that prison "is no place you'd ever want to be." In this slender volume, he explains why: the cramped quarters, lack of freedom and privacy, homesickness, violence and daily indignities (strip searches, having to use the toilet in public). Williams often goes beyond mere description, asking readers to imagine or emulate his experiences ("To get a feel for what it's like to live in a prison cell, test yourself. Spend ten hours?nonstop and alone?in your bathroom"), an effective technique. Though the book's stated goal is to warn kids away from Williams's path, its matter-of-fact, often homogenized tone connotes more of a plea for sympathy than a caution intended to frighten kids.

Collins breaks down the components of whittling-stop cut, paring cut, push cut, etc.-without ignoring its chief points: relaxation and pleasure, "absorbing in [their] elemental simplicity."

As Dr. Kent Kiehl shows, psychopaths can be identified by a checklist of symptoms that includes pathological lying; lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse; grandiose sense of self-worth; manipulation; and failure to accept one&#x2019;s actions. But why do psychopaths behave the way they do? Is it the result of their environment&#x2014; how they were raised&#x2014;or is there a genetic compo�nent to their lack of conscience? <br><br> This is the question Kiehl, a prot�g� of famed psychopath researcher Dr. Robert Hare, was deter�mined to answer as he began his career twenty years ago. To aid in his quest to unravel the psy�chopathic mind, Kiehl created the first mobile functional MRI scanner to study psychopaths in prison populations. The brains of more than five hundred psychopaths and three thousand other offenders have been scanned by Kiehl&#x2019;s labora�tory&#x2014;the world&#x2019;s largest forensic neuroscience repository of its kind. Over the course of <i>The Psy�chopath Whisperer</i>, we follow the scientific bread crumbs that Kiehl uncovered to show that the key brain structures that correspond with emotional engagement and reactions are diminished in psy�chopaths, offering new clues to how to predict and treat the disorder. <br><br> In <i>The Psychopath Whisperer</i>, Kiehl describes in fascinating detail his years working with psy�chopaths and studying their thought processes&#x2014; from the remorseless serial killers he meets with behind bars to children whose behavior and per�sonality traits exhibit the early warning signs of psychopathy. <br><br> Less than 1 percent of the general population meets the criteria for psychopathy. But psycho�paths account for a vastly outsized proportion of violent crimes. And as Kiehl shows, many who aren&#x2019;t psychopaths exhibit some of the behaviors and traits associated with the condition. What do you do if you discover your roommate, or boss, or the person you are dating has traits that define a psy�chopath? And what does having a diminished limbic region of the brain mean for how the legal system approaches crimes committed by psychopaths? <br><br> A compelling narrative of cutting-edge science, <i>The Psychopath Whisperer </i>will open your eyes on a fascinating but little understood world, with startling implications for society, the law, and our personal lives.</p><p><b>KENT A.

Contrary to popular belief, headbangers and the music they love are more alive than ever. Yet there has never been a comprehensive book on the history of heavy metal - until now. Featuring interviews with members of the biggest bands in the genre, Sound of the Beast gives an overview of the past 30-plus years of heavy metal, delving into the personalities of those who created it. Everything is here, from the bootlegging beginnings of fans like Lars Ulrich (future founder of Metallica) to the sold-out stadiums and personal excesses of the biggest groups. From heavy metal's roots in the work of breakthrough groups such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin to MTV hair metal, courtroom controversies, black metal murderers and Ozzfest, Sound of the Beast offers the final word on this elusive, extreme, and far-reaching form of music. </p></p><p><p>Ian Christe grew up in the metal strongholds of Switzerland, NewMexico, Indiana, Germany, and Washington. He moved to New York Cityin 1992, and has covered emerging technology and fringe culture forReuters, <em>Wired</em>, and Salon.com. His hundreds of articles on heavymetal have appeared in <em>Spin</em>, <em>AP</em>, <em>CMJ</em>, <em>Metal Maniacs</em>, and the <em>Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock</em> and been cited by <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>Few books on heavy metal music can compare to Christe's thoughtful and passionate history of the music of the beast. There is little argument that heavy metal began in earnest with Black Sabbath (though the Beatles' "Helter Skelter" is considered by some to be the first heavy metal song), and Christe holds to convention and begins his metal timeline in early 1970. Following in the jamming, bluesy tradition of the Yard Birds and Cream, Sabbath (then called Earth) wrote "Black Sabbath"-a song that changed not only the band's name, but the face of rock and roll. Black Sabbath set the pace, but bands like Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple "fleshed out the edges and gave it sex appeal." The next wave, the new wave of British heavy metal, saw the emergence of Motorhead, Saxon and Iron Maiden among many others. The movement then spread through America and found most bands cropping up out of L.A. (although many migrated from the Midwest). Van Halen, Ratt and Motley Crue grew out of the then underground club scene. Christe doesn't get bogged down in anecdotes about bands and their groupies, but instead documents the music and its different genres. Each chapter contains helpful "genre boxes" giving a brief description of the style (e.g., Power Metal, Death Metal and Nu Metal). If Christe is to be faulted, it is on the grounds of hero worship: he's a metal fan, scribe (a music writer living in Brooklyn) and practitioner (in a digital metal band called Black Noerd), and readers might wish for more critical analysis about the culture of fans. But this is a minor point in a book otherwise worthy of having its dog-eared and beer-stained pages passed among friends and placed in motel-room bedside drawers. 94 b&amp;w photos, and 16-page color insert not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples</h2><p>This volume will revise the way we look at the modern populations of Latin America and North America by providing a totally new view of the history of Native American and African American peoples throughout the hemisphere.

Now in its tenth year of publication, the book remains the clearest, most inviting and readable guide to the Hebrew Bible around&#x2014;and a profound meditation on the effect that modern biblical scholarship has had on traditional belief.<br> <br>Moving chapter by chapter, Harvard professor James Kugel covers the Bible&#x2019;s most significant stories&#x2014;the Creation of the world, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, Abraham and Sarah, Jacob and his wives, Moses and the exodus, David&#x2019;s mighty kingdom, plus the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the other prophets, and on to the Babylonian conquest and the eventual return to Zion.<br> <br>Throughout, Kugel contrasts the way modern scholars understand these events with the way Christians and Jews have traditionally understood them. The latter is not, Kugel shows, a na�ve reading; rather, it is the product of a school of sophisticated interpreters who flourished toward the end of the biblical period. These highly ideological readers sought to put their own spin on texts that had been around for centuries, utterly transforming them in the process. Their interpretations became <i>what the Bible meant</i> for centuries and centuries&#x2014;until modern scholarship came along. The question that this book ultimately asks is: What now? As one reviewer wrote, Kugel&#x2019;s answer provides &#x201c;a contemporary model of how to read Sacred Scripture amidst the oppositional pulls of modern scholarship and tradition.&#x201d;</p><p>James L.

The book will also cover all the major events, from the story of Adam and Eve to the exodus from Egypt, and on to the conquest of the land, the rise of the United Monarchy, the fall of Jerusalem, the Babylonian exile, and Israel's eventual return to its homeland. Along with people and events, the Bible's major passages will themselves be examined -- all the most important prophecies and psalms, laws, songs, and sayings.</p><p>In going through the Bible, however, this book will focus not only on what the text says but on the larger question of what a modern reader is to make of it, how it is to be read. This will mean examining two quite different ways of understanding the Bible, those of modern biblical scholars and of ancient interpreters.</p><p>By modern biblical scholars is meant a rather specific group of people (and not all modern people who study the Bible). Starting around 150 years ago, a major effort was launched in universities and divinity schools in different countries -- principally in Germany and Scandinavia, Holland, England, and the United States -- to understand the Bible afresh, reading it "scientifically" and without any presuppositions. A great deal of new information had just then begun to emerge that might shed light on the world of the Bible's creation. The fledgling science of archaeology had started to probe the distant past, first uncovering individual artifacts and treasures from ancient times, later whole towns and cities. Sometimes what the archaeologists found included bits of writing -- inscriptions from here and there, indeed, whole libraries of documents written by ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, and other neighboring civilizations of biblical Israel. These texts were deciphered and translated. Using this new information, biblical scholars found themselves able to trace with new accuracy the whole history of the region and fill in many of the blanks left by the Bible itself. They also began to reflect on the nature of Israelite society and its institutions in the light of these neighboring civilizations. Most of all, they set themselves to analyzing the Bible itself in a new way, trying to fit its words to the emerging historical picture and to understand when and how and for what purpose different parts of it were written.</p><p>This effort to reinterpret the Bible has been carried on with increasing intensity ever since, and it has produced spectacular results. We are now able to piece together answers to some of the most basic questions about the Bible: Where did the people of Israel come from? How did they come to believe in the existence of only one God? How did they worship Him? What do we know about specific historical events -- for example, when did Moses live, and who was the wicked pharaoh that would not let the Israelites leave Egypt? Moreover, what about the Bible itself -- when were its various books written, and by whom?</p><p>All these questions, and their answers, belong under the heading "modern biblical scholarship." As this book proceeds through the different parts of the Bible, it will survey most of what modern scholars have discovered about the meaning of the text and its historical background. But that is only part of the material to be studied.</p><p>Along with modern biblical scholars, this book will examine another set of interpreters, who lived long before the archaeologists, historians, and linguists came along. These are the ancient interpreters, a largely anonymous group of scholars who flourished from around 300 bce to 200 ce or so. By the time the ancient interpreters came along, most of the texts that make up our Bible had been around for quite a while -- many for hundreds and hundreds of years, in fact. But this was still a very important moment in the Bible's development, and these ancient interpreters played a significant role. It was a time when, as never before, the Bible had become the central focus of Israel's religion. Reading Scripture, and doing what it said, was now the very essence of Judaism -- and in its wake, Christianity. But what did Scripture mean, and what was it telling people to do? For various reasons, ordinary readers did not feel capable of deciding such things. It was up to the experts -- the ancient interpreters -- to explain the Bible to them.</p><p>As a result, the work of these ancient interpreters proved to be tremendously significant. As will be seen, they had a rather idiosyncratic, even quirky, way of interpreting the Bible. For example, they believed that the Bible did not always say openly what it meant; it was full of cryptic hints, and when these were carefully studied, all manner of hidden meanings could be revealed. In reading this way, ancient interpreters sometimes deduced the existence of whole incidents or teachings that the Bible had never mentioned -- indeed, they often "found" here and there doctrines or ideas that came into existence only centuries after the biblical text in question had been written. Their interpretations soon became what the Bible meant. Their explanations of different stories and laws and prophecies were passed on for centuries afterward. Institutionalized by church and synagogue, preached and sung about, depicted in floor mosaics, stained-glass windows, paintings, and statues, endlessly talked about in monasteries and on village greens, echoed in poetry and philosophy and learned discourse of all kinds, this interpreted Bible (that is, the Bible as explained by the ancient interpreters) was the Bible all throughout the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and to a large extent, even up to today.</p><p>One might well ask: now that modern biblical scholars have come to understand what biblical texts really meant when they were first written down, why should anyone bother with what a group of ancient interpreters thought the Bible meant centuries later, especially if their interpretations were sometimes a bit stretched? Part of the answer has already been given. For most of our history, what the Bible meant was what the ancient interpreters had said it meant. Even if what they said does not match the findings of modern scholars, this does not mean that their interpretations have not been, or are not still, significant. As a matter of fact, anyone who wants to understand European painting or sculpture, or the history of Western thought, or Dante or Milton or Shakespeare or almost any writer up to the present day, must know something about the Bible as it was understood by these ancient interpreters -- since that was the Bible.</p><p>But there is an even more important reason for studying both ancient interpreters and modern biblical scholars. In a way that will be made clear throughout this book, the ancient interpreters are still with us. Despite the rise of archaeology and other sciences, the ancient interpreters' way of reading is directly tied to some of the most basic things we still think today about the Bible -- its very standing as the Word of God, and its role as a guide to daily life -- as well as to our understanding of some of its most important parts, from the Garden of Eden to the prophecies of Isaiah and Daniel.</p><p>Modern readers of the Bible are thus caught between two opposite ways of reading. On the one hand, the ancient interpreters' way is crucial for what most people still wish to believe about the Bible and its message. On the other hand, the way of modern scholars, which seems to make good, scientific sense, has undermined a great deal of what those ancient interpreters said. So what are we to do? If we adopt the modern scholars' way of reading, in a very real sense the whole Bible will be undone -- much of its ethical instruction, its basic commandments, prophetic visions, and heartfelt prayers will turn out to be something other than what they have always seemed; indeed, the divine inspiration of all of Scripture will be seen to be undermined. But surely we cannot simply hide our heads in the sand and pretend that modern scholarship does not exist. And so an enormous question now poses itself to both Jews and Christians: How to read the Bible? That is the subject of this book.</p><p>WARNING: This book is intended for both the specialist and the general reader, those who already have great familiarity with the Bible and those who have never read a page of it. It is my hope that any reader will be able to learn a great deal from it. But there is one group of readers who must be cautioned about its contents. Precisely because this book deals with modern biblical scholarship, many of the things it discusses contradict the accepted teachings of Judaism and Christianity and may thus be disturbing to people of traditional faith. I should say that I count myself in this group, and some of the things I will relate have indeed been disturbing to me over the years. I hesitated for a long time before deciding to pursue modern biblical scholarship as my field of study, and I hesitated even longer before deciding to commit my thoughts on it to writing. If I nonetheless went ahead, it was because I felt that it was dishonest, and ultimately would prove impossible, to hide from the central question addressed by this book. Others, of course, may feel differently. It is up to them to decide whether or not to continue.</p><p>A word about the book's format: This book comes with two sets of notes. The first contain points of information intended for the general reader. These are marked with an asterisk (*) in the text and appear at the bottom of the page.

This edition is a companion book to the popular EngineerGuy YouTube series of the lectures. This books contains supplemental material to help readers appreciate Faraday&#x2019;s key insight that &#x201c;there is no more open door by which you can enter into the study of science than by considering the physical phenomena of a candle.&#x201d; Through a careful examination of a burning candle, Faraday&#x2019;s lectures introduce readers to the concepts of mass, density, heat conduction, capillary action, and convection currents. They demonstrate the difference between chemical and physical processes, such as melting, vaporization, incandescence, and all types of combustion. And the lectures reveal the properties of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, including their relative masses and the makeup of the atmosphere. The lectures wrap up with a grand, and startling, analogy: by understanding the chemical behavior of a candle the reader can grasp the basics of respiration. To help readers understand Faraday&#x2019;s key points this book has an &#x201c;Essential Background&#x201d; section that explains in modern terms how a candle works, introductory guides for each lecture written in contemporary language, and seven student activities with teaching guides.</p><p>Bill Hammack is a Professor of Chemical &amp; Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois&#x2014;Urbana, where he focuses on educating the public about engineering and science.

You&#x2019;ll also find echoes of the spice trade that fueled much of the Italian economy in centuries past in pasta sauces that call for nutmeg, cinnamon, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, and other spices. But what you&#x2019;ll find most of all is a tremendous variety of sauces that draw on the bounty of land and sea, on the ingenuity of the home cook, and on the imperative of letting the pasta itself be the star of the plate. No sauce is so intense as to mask the pasta it is served with. No sauce is so plentiful as to drown the pasta it is tossed with. The sauce is merely a vehicle for enjoying the pasta, and it is a vehicle that changes marvelously from region to region, depending on what local cooks can find in their gardens and on what has informed their cooking over the centuries.</p><h2>Children Learn What They Live: Parenting to Inspire Values</h2><p><p><b>The timeless <i>New York Times</i> bestselling guide to parenting that shows the power of inspiring values through example.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> A unique handbook to raising children with a compassionate, steady hand&#x2014;and to giving them the support and confidence they need to thrive.

The expanded version maintains the grace and wisdom of the original, yet adds significant insight into the process of encouraging values through example. "If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn," begins the poem (and the book), and so Nolte and Harris suggest effective ways to avoid or prevent constant criticism. As a set of guiding principals, as teaching tools, or as gentle reminders, Nolte and Harris's approach to teaching values to children encapsulates the best in parenting wisdom. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i>This book can help you become the parent you have always wanted to be, and raise the kind of children you can always be proud of. --From the foreword by Jack Canfield, co-author of Chicken Soup for the Soul<p>"If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn...If children live with acceptance, they learn to love." Expanding on her universally loved poem, "Children Learn What They Live," which has nourished countless families since its initial publication in 1954, Dorothy Law Nolte offers a simple but powerful guide to parenting-by inspiring values through example. Addressing issues of security, self-worth, tolerance, honesty, fear, respect, fairness, patience, and more, this book of rare common sense will help a new generation of parents find their own parenting wisdom and draw out their child's immense inner resources.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Power of the Seed: Your Guide to Oils for Health &amp; Beauty (Process Self-reliance Series)</h2><p><p>Fixed oils play a large part in most all commercial beauty treatments. <i>Power of the Seed</i> offers instruction on how to use these oils to create topical skin care, cosmetics, and massage oils.

So exploring biblical perspectives on justice can help us appreciate some of the convictions and values that have helped shape Western political and judicial thought. Christians also regard the Bible as a uniquely important source of guidance on matters of belief and practice. What the Bible has to say about justice, therefore&#x2014;both social justice and criminal justice&#x2014;ought to be of great significance for Christian thought and action today.&nbsp;Yet coming to grips with biblical teaching on justice is by no means easy."<br><br> Upfront, Marshall addresses the many complexities that surround "justice" in the Bible: the Bible seems to hold conflicting points of view; there is a huge amount of data to deal with; the world of the Bible and our present world are vastly different.&nbsp;Marshall's honest treatment of this subject is direct, yet almost lyrical in tone.

No exceptions.</b></p><p>Emmy Kegler has a complicated relationship with the Bible. As a queer woman who grew up in both conservative Evangelical and progressive Protestant churches, she knows too well how Scripture can be used to wound and exclude. And yet, the stories of Scripture continue to captivate and inspire her--both as a person of faith and as a pastor to a congregation. So she set out to fall in love with the Bible, wrestling with the stories inside, where she met a God who continues to seek us out--appearing again and again as a voice, a presence, and a promise.</p><p>Whenever we are pushed to the edges, our voices silenced, or our stories dismissed, God goes out after us--seeking us until we are found again. And God is seeking out those whose voices we too quickly silence and dismiss, too. Because God's story is a story of welcome and acceptance for everyone--no exceptions.</p><p>Kegler shows us that even when we feel like lost and dusty coins--rusted from others' indifference, misspent and misused--God picks up a broom and sweeps every corner of creation to find us.</p></p><p><p><b>Emmy Kegler</b> is pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in Northeast Minneapolis. She is the coordinator and editor of Queer Grace, an online encyclopedia for LGBTQ and Christian life, and a sought-after speaker.</p>"What Emmy Kegler accomplishes in <i>One Coin Found</i> is stunning in its brilliance and subtle in its goals. By taking you through her journey with Christ, she invites you to take a look at your own journey. The real idea you are left with at the end is that if the Jesus you have isn't liberating good news for queer folk, then it may not be Jesus at all. It makes this book a must read for anyone who wants to ponder the church's place in the twenty - first century." --Rev. Lenny Duncan, Pastor/Developer, Jehu's Table, and author of <i>Dear Church: A Love Letter from a Black Preacher to the Whitest Denomination in the US</i> <br><br> "Emmy Kegler's memoir is a Nouwen - esque gift for all hungry souls. Her critical curiosity is fierce, yet her pastoral heart is deeply faithful in pointing us toward Divine grace. Theologically rich, devotionally elegant, <i>One Coin Found</i> is divinely memorable!" --Jennifer Knapp, singer/songwriter, author, and founder of Inside Out Faith<br><br>"In <i>One Coin Found</i>, Emmy Kegler tells us a story about struggling with mental illness, wrestling with faith, and rejecting human rejection in favor of God's infuriating grace. Her questions, her vulnerability, and her skill as a storyteller invite us into a place where we can be honest about who we are and be loved for it. <i>One Coin Found</i> provides that space for everyone, but especially for those of us who identify as LGBTQIA. This book is a balm for weary souls." --Austen Hartke, author of <i>Transforming: The Bible and the Lives of Transgender Christians</i> <br><br> "In <i>One Coin Found</i>, Emmy Kegler breathes new, liberating life into the words and stories of Scripture that far too many have experienced only as tools of exclusion and oppression. As a queer woman who has been called to preach and to lead, Kegler's journey of faith has been a doubly difficult one, granting her a credibility and relatability among those who have been hurt by the church that is all too uncommon among religious leaders. This book is beautifully written, and Kegler's words will prove a balm to so many readers who barely knew how much they needed to read them." --Matthew Vines, executive director of The Reformation Project and author of <i>God and the Gay Christian: The Biblical Case in Support of Same-Sex Relationships</i><br><br>"In the years I have known Emmy Kegler, I have found her to be everything you will discover in these pages: wise, nurturing, pastoral, anointed, strong, honest, and deeply loving. She has given us such a gift with this book. I found myself weeping, not in sorrow, but in gratitude and awe as she wrote of God and Scripture and story and the ones who are lost. Reading <i>One Coin Found</i> was like hearing the gospel for the first time all over again and remembering just why this story is so glorious. For those who are the lost coin, the prodigal son, or the lost sheep, Kegler is the pastor you deserved all along, and just wait, you're about to learn what it really means to be fully found." --Sarah Bessey, author of <i>Jesus Feminist</i> and <i>Out of Sorts: Making Peace with an Evolving Faith</i></p><h2>Lonely Planet Europe (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s number one travel guide publisher*</i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet&#x2019;s <i>Europe</i> </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Stalin, hitherto a distant figure, has suddenly denounced the young composer&#x2019;s latest opera. Certain he will be exiled to Siberia (or, more likely, shot dead on the spot), Shostakovich reflects on his predicament, his personal history, his parents, his daughter&#x2014;all of those hanging in the balance of his fate. And though a stroke of luck prevents him from becoming yet another casualty of the Great Terror, he will twice more be swept up by the forces of despotism: coerced into praising the Soviet state at a cultural conference in New York in 1948, and finally bullied into joining the Party in 1960. All the while, he is compelled to constantly weigh the specter of power against the integrity of his music. An extraordinary portrait of a relentlessly fascinating man, <i>The Noise of Time</i> is a stunning meditation on the meaning of art and its place in society.</p><p>Julian Barnes&nbsp;is the author of twenty previous books. He has received the Man Booker Prize, the Somerset Maugham Award, the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, the David Cohen Prize for Literature and the E. M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters; in France, the Prix M�dicis and the Prix Femina; and in Austria, the State Prize for European Literature. In 2004 he was named Commandeur de l&#x2019;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. His work has been translated into more than forty languages. He lives in London.<br><br> www.julianbarnes.comAnd so, it had all begun, very precisely, on the morning of the 28th of January 1936, in Arkhangelsk. He had been invited to perform his first piano concerto with the local orchestra under Viktor Kubatsky; the two of them had also played his new cello sonata. It had gone well. The next morning he went to the railway station to buy a copy of <i>Pravda. </i>He had looked at the front page briefly, then turned to the next two. It was, as he would later put it, the most memorable day of his life. And a date he chose to mark each year until his death.<br><br>Except that&#x2014;as his mind obstinately argued back&#x2014;nothing ever begins as precisely as that. It began in different places, and in different minds. The true starting point might have been his own fame. Or his opera. Or it might have been Stalin, who, being infallible, was therefore responsible for everything. Or it could have been caused by something as simple as the layout of an orchestra. Indeed, that might finally be the best way of looking at it: a composer first denounced and humiliated, later arrested and shot, all because of the layout of an orchestra.<br><br>If it all began elsewhere, and in the minds of others, then perhaps he could blame Shakespeare, for having written <i>Macbeth. </i>Or Leskov for Russifying it into <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. </i>No, none of that. It was, self-evidently, his own fault for having written the piece that offended. It was his opera&#x2019;s fault for being such a success&#x2014;at home and abroad&#x2014;it had aroused the curiosity of the Kremlin. It was Stalin&#x2019;s fault because he would have inspired and approved the <i>Pravda </i>editorial&#x2014;perhaps even written it himself: there were enough grammatical errors to suggest the pen of one whose mistakes could never be corrected. It was also Stalin&#x2019;s fault for imagining himself a patron and connoisseur of the arts in the first place. He was known never to miss a performance of <i>Boris Godunov </i>at the Bolshoi. He was almost as keen on <i>Prince Igor </i>and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x2019;s <i>Sadko. </i>Why should Stalin not want to hear this acclaimed new opera, <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</i>?<br><br>And so, the composer was instructed to attend a performance of his own work on the 26th of January 1936. Comrade Stalin would be there; also Comrades Molotov, Mikoyan and Zhdanov. They took their places in the government box. Which had the misfortune to be situated immediately above the percussion and the brass. Sections which in <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>were not scored to behave in a modest and self-effacing fashion.<br><br>He remembered looking across from the director&#x2019;s box, where he was seated, to the government box. Stalin was hidden behind a small curtain, an absent presence to whom the other distinguished comrades would sycophantically turn, knowing that they were themselves observed. Given the occasion, both conductor and orchestra were understandably nervous. In the entr&#x2019;acte before Katerina&#x2019;s wedding, the woodwind and brass suddenly took it upon themselves to play more loudly than he had scored. And then it was like a virus spreading through each section. If the conductor noticed, he was powerless. Louder and louder the orchestra became; and every time the percussion and brass roared fortissimo beneath them&#x2014;loud enough to knock out windowpanes&#x2014;Comrades Mikoyan and Zhdanov would shudder theatrically, turn to the figure behind the curtain and make some mocking remark. When the audience looked up to the government box at the start of the fourth act, they saw that it had been vacated.<br><br> After the performance, he had collected his briefcase and gone straight to the Northern Station to catch the train for Arkhangelsk. He remembered thinking that the government box had been specially reinforced with steel plates, to protect its occupants against assassination. But that there was no such cladding to the director&#x2019;s box. He was not yet thirty, and his wife was five months pregnant at the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1936: he had always been superstitious about leap years. Like many people, he believed that they brought bad luck.<br><br> #<br><br> Those who did not know him, and who followed music only from a distance, probably imagined that this had been his first setback. That the brilliant nineteen-year-old whose First Symphony was quickly taken up by Bruno Walter, then by Toscanini and Klemperer, had known nothing but a clear, clean decade of success since that premiere in 1926. And such people, perhaps aware that fame often leads to vanity and self-importance, might open their <i>Pravda </i>and agree that composers could easily stray from writing the kind of music people wanted to hear. And further, since all composers were employed by the state, that it was the state&#x2019;s duty, if they offended, to intervene and draw them back into greater harmony with their audience. This sounded entirely reasonable, didn&#x2019;t it?<br><br>Except that they had practised sharpening their claws on his soul from the beginning: while he was still at the Conservatoire a group of Leftist fellow students had tried to have him dismissed and his stipend removed. Except that the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians and similar cultural organisations had campaigned from their inception against what he stood for; or rather, what they thought he stood for. They were determined to break the bourgeois stranglehold on the arts. So workers must be trained to become composers, and all music must be instantly comprehensible and pleasing to the masses. Tchaikovsky was decadent, and the slightest experimentation condemned as &#x201c;formalism.&#x201d;<br><br>Except that as early as 1929 he had been officially denounced, told that his music was &#x201c;straying from the main road of Soviet art,&#x201d; and sacked from his post at the Choreographic Technical College. Except that in the same year Misha Kvadri, the dedicatee of his First Symphony, became the first of his friends and associates to be arrested and shot.<br><br> Except that in 1932, when the Party dissolved the independent organisations and took charge of all cultural matters, this had resulted not in a taming of arrogance, bigotry and ignorance, rather in a systematic concentration of them. And if the plan to take a worker from the coal face and turn him into a composer of symphonies did not exactly come to pass, something of the reverse happened. A composer was expected to increase his output just as a coal miner was, and his music was expected to warm hearts just as a miner&#x2019;s coal warmed bodies. Bureaucrats assessed musical output as they did other categories of output; there were established norms, and deviations from those norms.<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> At Arkhangelsk railway station, opening <i>Pravda </i>with chilled fingers, he had found on page three a headline identifying and condemning deviance: muddle instead of music. He determined at once to return home via Moscow, where he would seek advice. On the train, as the frozen landscape passed, he reread the article for the fifth and sixth times. Initially, he had been shocked as much for his opera as for himself: after such a denunciation, <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>could not possibly continue at the Bolshoi. For the last two years, it had been applauded everywhere&#x2014;from New York to Cleveland, from Sweden to Argentina. In Moscow and Leningrad, it had pleased not just the public and the critics, but also the political commissars. At the time of the 17th Party Congress its performances had been listed as part of the Moscow district&#x2019;s official output, which aimed to compete with the production quotas of the Donbass coal miners.<br><br>All this meant nothing now: his opera was to be put down like a yapping dog which had suddenly displeased its master. He tried to analyse the different elements of the attack as clearheadedly as possible. First, his opera&#x2019;s very success, especially abroad, was turned against it. Only a few months before, <i>Pravda </i>had patriotically reported the work&#x2019;s American premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. Now the same paper knew that <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>had only succeeded outside the Soviet Union because it was &#x201c;non-political and confusing,&#x201d; and because it &#x201c;tickled the perverted taste of the bourgeois with its fidgety, neurotic music.&#x201d;<br><br>Next, and linked to this, was what he thought of as government-box criticism, an articulation of those smirks and yawns and sycophantic turnings towards the hidden Stalin. So he read how his music &#x201c;quacks and grunts and growls&#x201d;; how its &#x201c;nervous, convulsive and spasmodic&#x201d; nature derived from jazz; how it replaced singing with &#x201c;shrieking.&#x201d; The opera had clearly been scribbled down in order to please the &#x201c;effete,&#x201d; who had lost all &#x201c;wholesome taste&#x201d; for music, preferring &#x201c;a confused stream of sound.&#x201d; As for the libretto, it deliberately concentrated on the most sordid parts of Leskov&#x2019;s tale: the result was &#x201c;coarse, primitive and vulgar.&#x201d;<br><br>But his sins were political as well. So the anonymous analysis by someone who knew as much about music as a pig knows about oranges was decorated with those familiar, vinegar-soaked labels. Petit-bourgeois, formalist, Meyerholdist, Leftist. The composer had written not an opera but an anti-opera, with music deliberately turned inside out. He had drunk from the same poisoned source which produced &#x201c;Leftist distortion in painting, poetry, teaching and science.&#x201d; In case it needed spelling out&#x2014;and it always did&#x2014;Leftism was contrasted with &#x201c;real art, real science and real literature.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Those that have ears will hear,&#x201d; he always liked to say. But even the stone deaf couldn&#x2019;t fail to hear what &#x201c;Muddle Instead of Music&#x201d; was saying, and guess its likely consequences. There were three phrases which aimed not just at his theoretical misguidedness but at his very person. &#x201c;The composer apparently never considered the problem of what the Soviet audience looks for and expects in music.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his membership in the Union of Composers. &#x201c;The dan�ger of this trend to Soviet music is clear.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his ability to compose and perform. And finally: &#x201c;It is a game of clever ingenuity that may end very badly.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his life.</p><h2>The Orange Outlaw (A to Z Mysteries)</h2><p><p><b>Help Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose solve mysteries from A to Z! </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Kids love collecting the entire alphabet and super editions!

Could it be another epic Redwall tale (tail?) thick with high adventure, heavy accents, and leek-and-turnip pasty from the beloved beast master himself, Brian Jacques? It is indeed, happy readers. <i>Triss</i>, the 15th book in the distinguished and wildly popular animal fantasy series, chronicles the exploits of a brave squirrel maid who travels from the bonds of slavery to the meeting of her destiny as a warrior at Redwall Abbey. Triss the squirrel, Shogg the otter, and Welfo the hedgehog, all slaves to the bloodthirsty royal ferret family of Riftgard, filch a ferret boat and sail away from the murderous clutches of Princess Kurda and her malevolent father, King Agarnu. Swearing revenge, Kurda sets out to recapture her slaves, her evil Ratguard troops reinforced by the pirate fox Plugg Firetail and his band of criminal Freebooters. At the same time, the badger Sagaxus and his bosom friend Bescarum the hare also set sail from Salamanstrom, to seek adventure on the high seas. Meanwhile, back at the abbey, the Redwall inhabitants are being plagued by a mystery that involves a hidden door, a secret code, and three stinking, sinister snake siblings that are picking off the gentle forest folk one by one. Any ardent fan of Redwall knows that what comes next will include sword fights, feasting, raucous good humor, and a thrilling climax. Jacques's fervent followers are rewarded with the author's usual swashbuckling good storytelling, while the newly initiated will read with wide eyes, and quickly go back to hungrily devour the rest of the series.

Now, in an entertaining and accessible primer, he explains how the global economy actually works--in real-world terms. Writing with irreverent wit, a deep knowledge of history, and a disregard for conventional economic pieties, Chang offers insights that will never be found in the textbooks. </p><p>Unlike many economists, who present only one view of their discipline, Chang introduces a wide range of economic theories, from classical to Keynesian, revealing how each has its strengths and weaknesses, and why there is no one way to explain economic behavior. Instead, by ignoring the received wisdom and exposing the myriad forces that shape our financial world, Chang gives us the tools we need to understand our increasingly global and interconnected world often driven by economics. From the future of the Euro, inequality in China, or the condition of the American manufacturing industry here in the United States--<i>Economics: The User&#x2019;s Guide</i> is a concise and expertly crafted guide to economic fundamentals that offers a clear and accurate picture of the global economy and how and why it affects our daily lives.</p></p><p><b>Ha-Joon Chang </b>was born in Seoul, South Korea, and teaches Economics and Development Studies at the University of Cambridge.

Over 90% of the population has a form of autoimmune disease and inflammation. Several autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis, and multiple sclerosis, afflict women anywhere from two to 10 times more often than they do men. Getting to the root cause to reverse autoimmunity is possible. There are 3 root causes that functional medicine doctors spend most of their time talking about. There is one more piece to the autoimmune puzzle that affects women more than it does men. Dr. Keesha Ewers calls this the &#x201c;missing piece&#x201d; of the complex autoimmune puzzle. Dr. Keesha is one of the 50 million Americans who received an autoimmune diagnosis. In Solving the Autoimmune Puzzle, she teaches the same Freedom Framework she used to reverse not only her own autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis), but also the autoimmunity in thousands of others.</p><p>Dr. Keesha Ewers is an integrative medicine expert, Doctor of Sexology, Psychotherapist and the founder and medical director of the Academy for Integrative Medicine Health Coach Certification Program. Dr. Keesha has been in the medical field for over 30 years.

Intended for parents, adoptive parents, foster parents and caretakers of at-risk, ADD/ADHD/RAD,ODD, adopted children and children with behavioral and emotional challenges<p>Bryan Post speaks to parents about the challenges they face when dealing with behaviors that are often present for adopted children. He helps parents understand the impact of early life trauma and the impact of interruptions in the attachment process. In his compassion for parents and children he offers hope and solutions for the challenges families face. Many parents of adopted children express their fear not only for their child s present behaviors, but for what will become of them in the future. Bryan's straightforward, clear-cut approach has created peace and healing for hundreds of families; families who once operated in fear, are now experiencing love.</p></p><p>Bryan Post is one of America s foremost child behavior experts. Founder and CEO of the Post Institute for Family-Centered Therapy. The Post Institute specializes in working with adults, children and families who struggle with issues related to early life trauma and the impact of trauma on the development of the mind body system.<p>A renowned clinician, lecturer, and author of many books (The Great Behavior Breakdown, From Fear to Love and co-authored Beyond Consequences, Logic and Control with Heather Forbes), video, and audio programs, Bryan has traveled throughout the world providing expert treatment and consultation to a variety of groups. An internationally recognized specialist in the treatment of emotional and behavioral, he specializes in a holistic family-based treatment approach that addresses the underlying interactive dynamics of the entire family, a neurophysiologic process he refers to as, The secret life of the family. Post contends that these same dynamics become obvious and are visibly apparent in every relationship.</p><p>He holds three degrees in the field of social work: a Bachelors of Social Work degree from East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma; a Masters of Social Work degree from the University of Texas at Arlington; and a Doctoral degree in Social Work from Columbus University School of Public Administration.</p><p>A maverick in the mental health field, Bryan broke from traditional teachings in the late 1990 s and developed a dynamic theoretical model of human behavior which he coined the Stress Model. When fully understood and applied to nearly any situation the stress model can reveal underlying unconscious expressive states which can transform relationship dynamics. From the Stress Model theory he has gone on to develop both Family-Centered Regulatory Parenting and Regulatory Therapy which both have been taught at the university level, garnering Post international recognition.</p><p>Of noted interest is also the fact that he has woven his therapy model into breakthrough educational experiences that are referred to as POST Camps for adults, parents, and therapists. These rapid results programs have been changing the lives of struggling adults, parents, and families for the past several years.</p><p>Bryan is a retired Clinical Social Worker, speaker, author and entrepreneur.

Even if you aren't into reading, this book is a must have. Each chapter has a section over-viewing the key concepts of that chapter. If you just go through and read those key concepts, you'll gain a new understanding of your relationship with your child. If you are thinking of adopting a child, please read this book. If you have adopted a child, please read this book. If you yourself have been adopted, please read this book. If you're a parent and have nothing to do with adoption in any manner, please read this book... Being a single mom of a child with special needs has it's difficulties. I've read mountains of books in search of answer to make things easier for both of us. That's right. I said 'mountains'. That may be a slight exaggeration, but it's slight. I want my child to feel safety and comfort because I love him. I'm not alone in this. Most parents feel that way. When you have a child that has autism, brain damage, rage issues, control issues or trauma, it can be difficult to figure out how to proceed with your child. When you adopt a child, you have no idea exactly what issues you're going to be facing until you face them. Although this book is geared towards parents of adopted children, I strongly urge every single parent to go buy this book. Most of the behaviors described in this book are not only found in adopted children. (I know you know that, Bryan! I'm just sayin!) Not only does this book explore how to handle the issues we have with our children, Bryan goes into detail to explain why these things occur. Through reading this book, we gain a better understanding of how our children work, how we work, and how we can work together to build a stronger family. I love the way this book is put together. Honestly, it's the best parenting handbook I've seen for someone with a child that has difficult behaviors. Reading it through the first time, you gain a basic understanding for the principles based in the book. It's a lot like being at an inspirational seminar where you have a charismatic man urging you to find your parenting potential and reach it. Bryan is a cross between Emeril and the Shamwow guy. Well, in writing mannerisms he is. Add to that a genuine concern for families and it makes this book just amazing to read through. After the initial read, go back and reread the chapters that pertain to you. Underline behaviors and triggers that you find that are pertinent to your relationship with your child. Even if you aren't into reading, this book is a must have. Each chapter has a section over-viewing the key concepts of that chapter. If you just go through and read those key concepts, you'll gain a new understanding of your relationship with your child. Again, I know this book is geared towards adopted children and families. If you are thinking of adopting a child, please read this book. If you have adopted a child, please read this book. If you yourself have been adopted, please read this book. If you're a parent and have nothing to do with adoption in any manner, please read this book. A greater understanding of our children and how to handle them can only help. --By Literary Litter (Warsaw, IN USA)<br><br>I am so glad I received this book to review as my 3 boys are adopted, and they are half brothers to each other. My boys are 1, 7, and 13 years old. I can relate to 90% if this book from the lying, defiance to aggression along with their ADHD that runs in their birth family. I have gone through these issues and this book really helps make things easier on the parents. You feel so much love for them even when they turn away you can not back down and threaten to send them back that is the last thing they want to hear. You never know how many foster families they have had to go through before coming to you and adopted them. I can say for my 13 year old he was in 6, my 7 year old 3 and my 11 month old thank goodness 1 family before we got him at 5 months. This book is a god send and so happy to have it. --babs-worldofbooks.blogspot.com<br><br>This is a life changing book that will give hope to so many families. It takes away so much of the guilt and profound sense of failure that seems to sadly be part of many families involved in adoption. For me, his statement that, until a child reaches his or her late 20 s there is still great opportunity for healing and change to occur, gives us all hope. For adoptive families that is such a major contrast to the usual doom of childcare experts and gives us the knowledge, based on brain research, that we can continue to make a difference in overcoming past traumas. Bryan tells us that healing happens in the home and the biggest difference in a child s life is a well regulated parent . This book will give people confidence in themselves as parents and to trust their own loving instincts. In contrast to many child care manuals based on traditional beliefs, Bryan s paradigm is backed up by the latest research in neuroscience. It is a highly accessible book with key points highlighted allowing readers to dip back in to be reminded and reassured that you can indeed move to Love --Jean Belton, UK</p><h2>Stock Market Investing for Beginners: Essentials to Start Investing Successfully</h2><p><p> "This book provides a good foundation for the beginning investor who is setting out to venture in the stock market.

Known for its medical advances, the famed teaching hospital has fitted several ORs as "hybrid operating rooms of the future"--an improvement that seems positive until an anesthesia error during a routine procedure results in the death of an otherwise healthy man. Noah suspects Dr. William Mason, an egotistical, world-class surgeon, of an error during the operation and for tampering with the patient's record afterward. But Mason is quick to blame anesthesiologist Dr. Ava London.<br><br>When more anesthesia-related deaths start to occur, Noah is forced to question all of the residents on his staff, including Ava, and quickly realizes there's more to her than what he sees. A social media junkie, Ava has created multiple alternate personas for herself on the Internet. With his own job and credibility now in jeopardy, Noah must decide which doctor is at fault and who he can believe--before any more lives are lost.</p><p><b>Robin Cook, MD,</b>&nbsp;is the author of more than 30 books and is credited with popularizing the medical thriller with his groundbreaking and wildly successful 1977 novel,&nbsp;<i>Coma</i>. He divides his time among Florida, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.<b>1 <br><p><b>Saturday, July 1, 4:45 a.m.</b></p><p>The smartphone alarm went off at 4:45 a.m. in Noah Rothauser&#x2019;s small and sparse third-floor one-bedroom apartment on Revere Street in Boston&#x2019;s Beacon Hill neighborhood. As a surgical resident at the Boston Memorial Hospital, it was the time Noah had been waking up just about every day except Sunday for five years. In the winter, it was pitch black and cold, since the building&#x2019;s heat didn&#x2019;t kick on until seven. At least now, in the summer, it was a bit easier to climb out of the bed because it was light in the room and a pleasant temperature, thanks to a noisy air conditioner in one of the rear-facing windows.</p><p>Stretching his sleepy muscles, Noah padded into the tiny bathroom buck naked. There had been a time when he wore pajamas as he had done as a child. But the habit had been abandoned when he came to appreciate that pajamas were just another piece of apparel he had to launder, and he wasn&#x2019;t fond of taking the time to do laundry, as it required walking a block up the street to a Laundromat and then waiting around. It was the waiting he couldn&#x2019;t abide. As a totally dedicated surgical resident, Noah chose to have little time for anything else, even personal necessities.</p><p>He eyed himself in the mirror, recognizing that he looked a little worse for wear. The evening before, he&#x2019;d had a couple drinks, which was rare for him. He ran his fingers up the sides of his face to decide if he could get away without shaving until after his first surgical case. Often he shaved in the surgical locker room to allow him to get to the hospital that much earlier. But then he remembered today wasn&#x2019;t a usual day, so there was no reason to hurry. Not only was it Saturday, with its usually light surgery schedule, but it was also July 1, the first day of the hospital year, called the Change Day, meaning a whole new batch of residents were beginning their training and the existing residents were advancing up the training ladder to the next level. For fifth-year residents, also considered chief residents, it was a different story. They were finished their training and were off to begin the next stage of their respective careers&#x2014;everybody except Noah. By a vote of the surgical faculty, Noah had been proud to be selected to do a final year as the super chief resident who would run the Boston Memorial Hospital surgical department on a daily basis like a traffic cop at a very busy intersection. In most other surgical residency programs, a super chief status rotated among the fifth-year chief residents. BMH was different. The super chief was an added year. With the help of a full-time residency program manager, Marjorie O&#x2019;Connor, and two coordinators under her, it was now Noah&#x2019;s job to schedule all the residents&#x2019; rotations in the various surgical specialties, their operating room responsibilities, their simulation center sessions, and their on-call duties. On top of that, he was responsible for work rounds, chief-of-�service rounds, and all the various weekly, biweekly, and monthly conferences, meetings, and academic lectures that made up the academic part of the surgical department&#x2019;s program. As a kind of mother hen, he also had to make sure that all the residents were appropriately fulfilling their clinical responsibilities, dutifully attending all the teaching venues, and handling the pressures of the job.</p><p>Without the usual need to rush to the hospital, Noah opened the medicine cabinet over the sink and took out shaving cream and a razor. While he lathered his face, he found himself smiling. His new job sounded like&nbsp;an enormous amount of work and effort, especially since he would have his own patients and be doing his own surgery at the same time, but he knew he was going to love the year. The hospital was his world, his universe, and as super chief he was to be the alpha-male surgical resident. It was an honor and a privilege to have been selected for the position, especially since on its completion, he was assured by precedent that he would be offered a full-time faculty position. This was huge. For Noah, the opportunity to be a full-time attending surgeon at one of the world&#x2019;s premier academic medical centers associated with one of the world&#x2019;s premier universities was the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It had been his goal for as long as he could remember. Finally, all the work, effort, sacrifice, and struggles in college, medical school, and now as a resident were going to pay off.</p><p>With quick strokes of the razor Noah made short work of his overnight stubble, then climbed into the tiny shower. A moment later he was out and vigorously drying himself. There was no doubt that it was going to be a very busy year, but on the positive side he would not have any official night call, even though, knowing himself, he&#x2019;d be spending most evenings in the hospital anyway. The difference was that he would be doing what he wanted to do with interesting cases that he&#x2019;d get to choose. And equally important, he would not be bogged down with busy work, the typical bane of house officers or hospital residents, particularly surgical residents, since there was always some menial task that had to be done, such as changing a dressing, advancing a drain, or debriding a gangrenous wound. Noah would be able to designate others to do all that stuff. For him, the learning opportunities were going to be off the charts.</p><p>The only fly in the ointment, and it was a big fly and a nagging, persistent worry for Noah, was the responsibility he now had for the damn bimonthly surgical Morbidity and Mortality, or M&amp;M, Conference. This conference was different from all the others, since Noah would not have the option of farming out any aspect of the responsibility to other residents. It was going to fall to him and him alone to investigate and then present all adverse-outcome cases, particularly those resulting in death.</p><p>Noah&#x2019;s fear of the M&amp;M Conference was not some irrational concern. Since the conference was specifically about cases that didn&#x2019;t turn out well, often involving mistakes and individual shortcomings, blame and finger- pointing in an emotionally charged environment with dirty laundry hung out for everyone to see was the norm and not the exception. Considering the egotistical mind-set of many of the surgeons, the atmosphere could be explosive and a breeding ground for hard feelings, with the potential of creating enemies unless an underling scapegoat could be found. Noah had seen it happen over the last five years, and the scapegoat often was the messenger: the presenting super chief resident. Noah worried that the same could happen to him now that he was super chief, especially considering the Bruce Vincent fiasco. The case had trouble written all over it for many reasons, not least of which was that Noah had been involved. Although Noah had never second-guessed his decision to put the man on emergency bypass, he knew others might.</p><p>Adding to Noah&#x2019;s concern, the death of the popular parking czar had the entire medical center in an uproar and gossip was rife. Prior to the event, Noah hadn&#x2019;t even known the man, because Noah didn&#x2019;t have a car and never had any reason to visit any of the hospital&#x2019;s three garages. Noah walked to work, and when the weather was bad, he merely stayed in the on-call facilities, which were expansive and more inviting than his own apartment. He&#x2019;d seen the kids&#x2019; photos on the cafeteria bulletin board but had never known whose children they were. Yet now he knew and understood he had been in a distinct minority of not being a Bruce Vincent fan, all of which was going to make the M&amp;M Conference a standing-room-only affair.</p><p>The main reason Noah was fearful was that the Vincent case involved Dr. Mason, who Noah knew to be egotistical, quick to export blame, and outspokenly critical of Noah. Over the previous year and a half, Noah had&nbsp;made an effort to stay out of the man&#x2019;s way as much as possible, yet now, with this next M&amp;M coming in less than two weeks, they were on a �definite collision course like a certain cruise ship and a giant wayward iceberg. Whatever Noah was going to find in his investigation of the case, he knew it was going to be a diplomatic nightmare. From the little the anesthesiologist had said at the time, it seemed to Noah that a considerable amount of responsibility had to be directed at Dr. Mason, who had been running two other concurrent surgeries. The concurrent-surgery issue alone was an emotionally charged hot-button issue within the department.</p><p>Noah ducked back into the bedroom and went to the bureau for underwear and socks. There were only three pieces of furniture in the room: the bureau, a queen-size bed, and a single bedside table that supported a lamp and a stack of medical journals. There were no pictures on the walls or any draperies over the two windows facing out into a rear courtyard. There were no rugs on the hardwood floor. If someone had asked Noah about the decor, he would have described it as spartan. But no one asked him. He didn&#x2019;t have visitors and wasn&#x2019;t there much himself, which was probably the reason he&#x2019;d experienced a few break-ins since Leslie had left. At first such episodes had bothered him as a personal violation, but since he had almost nothing to lose, he came to accept it as part of city living with lots of impecunious students visiting the tenants above him. Mostly, however, he didn&#x2019;t want to take the time or effort of finding a new apartment. In lots of ways he didn&#x2019;t even consider it a home. It was more a place to crash a few times a week for five or six hours.</p><p>There had been a time several years ago when he&#x2019;d felt differently, and the apartment had been warm and cozy with things such as throw rugs, framed prints of famous paintings on the wall, and curtains over the windows. There had also been a small writing desk covered with framed photos, and a second bedside table. But all that homey stuff had belonged to Leslie Brooks, Noah&#x2019;s long-term girlfriend, who had come with Noah from New York to go to Harvard Business School after she graduated from Columbia in economics and he in medicine. She had lived with Noah until she finished her graduate degree two years ago, but after graduation had moved back to New York with all her stuff to a great job in finance.</p><p>Leslie&#x2019;s departure had taken Noah by surprise, until she&#x2019;d explained that she had come to the realization over the three years that his professional commitment was such that there was little room for her. Most surgical residents got progressively more time with their families as they advanced up the residency ladder. Not so with Noah. Each year his hours got longer by choice. There had been no rancor on either of their parts when they went their separate ways, even though Noah had been initially crushed, as he had come to assume they would marry at some point. Yet he quickly realized that she was right and he had been selfish with his time and attention. At least until he finished his graduate training, which he thought of as a 24/7 activity, he was metaphorically married to medicine and had spent very little time in her company and in the apartment.</p><p>On occasion Noah missed Leslie and looked forward to their monthly FaceTime phone calls, which she made the effort to continue. Each considered the other to be a true friend. Noah was aware she was now engaged, which tugged at his heartstrings when he thought about it. At the same time, he was thankful that she had been forthright about her needs, and he was relieved that her contentment was no longer his responsibility. At least until his residency was over, medicine was his overly demanding mistress. Ultimately, he truly wished the best for her.</p><p>From the closet Noah got a white shirt and a tie and went back into the bathroom to put them on. Once he was satisfied with the knot, which often took several attempts, he dealt with his rather thick, closely cropped dirty-blond hair by parting it on the left and brushing most of the rest to the right and off his face. Back when he had been a typical teenager, Noah had been vain and worried about his looks. He had spent a lot of time wanting to believe he was a stud, as a couple girls had referred to him. Although he wasn&#x2019;t exactly sure what they had meant, he had taken it as a great compliment. Now he was not concerned about his appearance other than to look appropriately doctorlike, which he interpreted as being reasonably manicured, with clean, pressed clothes. He despised those residents who thought it a badge of honor to wear wrinkled, bloodstained outfits, especially scrubs, to advertise how hard they were working.</p><p>Noah was a bit more than six feet in height and still appeared athletic, even though he&#x2019;d not had time for athletics since he&#x2019;d graduated from college. Still weighing in at 165 pounds, he had never gained weight like some of his high school friends, despite not getting much aerobic exercise. He attributed his good luck to rarely taking the time to eat and to having decent genes, thanks to his father, which might have been the only positive thing he got from him. In the looks category, what made him the proudest was his chiseled nose separating emerald-green eyes. The eyes were a gift from his redheaded mother.</p><p>The final act of dressing before heading off to the hospital involved his white pants and white jacket, both of which he was known to change several times in the same day, taking advantage that they were cleaned and pressed by the hospital laundry. When he was fully ready, with his computer tablet in his side pocket, he checked himself in the mirror that hung in the living room. The mirror had belonged to Leslie, and why she had left it she had never explained, nor had he asked. Otherwise, the living room was almost as stark as the bedroom. The furniture consisted of a small threadbare couch, a coffee table, a floor lamp, a folding card table with two folding chairs, and a small bookcase. An elderly laptop sat on the card table as the sole remnant of his teenage love of computer gaming. The only wall decorations in the room were a simple brick mantel painted white and the mirror. Like the bedroom windows, the living room windows were bare. They looked out onto Revere Street and the typical Beacon Hill brick buildings opposite.</p></b></p><h2>Freedom Flight - The Origins of Mental Power</h2><p>Olympic Silver Medalist, Lanny Bassham, was feeling truly defeated and sorry for himself due to his failure to reach his ultimate goal.

Scandinavians are inspired by light, having an abundance of it in summer but so little of it in winter, and house designs tend to maximize the amount of natural light that enters the home, and allow the inhabitants to make the most of outdoor life during the summer. Similarly, nature and the weather are major influences: homes are made warm and cozy for the freezing winter months&#x2014;not just literally with log burners, but also through incorporating wood and natural materials. Here Niki Brantmark, owner of the interior design blog <b>My Scandinavian Home</b>, presents a wide-ranging collection of these beautiful homes and explores how the Scandinavian lifestyle is reflected in them all. The first chapter, Urban Living, features styles ranging from minimalist to bohemian, and pale palettes to dramatic dark colors. By contrast, the Country Homes tend to have a softer, calmer feel, through color and textiles, in line with a slower pace of life. Finally, the spectacular Rural Retreats include a mountain cabin, beach house, and rustic summer cottage, and demonstrate how having somewhere to escape to is so important to many Scandinavians. This collection of stunning interiors will put Scandi style within every reader&#x2019;s reach.</p><p><p>Discover classic and contemporary Scandinavian style with specially commissioned photography of homes in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.</p>Niki Brantmark runs the daily interior design blog My Scandinavian Home, which was inspired by her move to Sweden from London over ten years ago.

This daily Lenten devotional offers a unique approach to fasting, helping you reexamine the psychological and spiritual roots of sin in your life while sharing reflections and prayer exercises for overcoming sinful habits and acquiring virtuous ones.<br><br> Lent is the ideal time to identify and address "spiritual blind spots"&#x2014;unacknowledged emotional wounds and false ideas that hinder your prayer life and worship.<br><br> During each week of Lent, Ken Kniepmann of the John Paul II Healing Center breaks open one of the seven deadly sins (pride, lust, gluttony, sloth, anger, envy, and greed) and its corresponding virtue (humility, chastity, abstinence, diligence, patience, kindness, and liberality). You'll start by learning about the sin and how it manifests itself in daily life and thought patterns. Then you'll move into reflection and prayer exercises that guide you through the process of renouncing that week's sin and resolving to adopt that week's virtue.<br><br> Fasting, the practice of giving up pleasures or comforts, allows us to grow in holiness by putting our desires to a kind of death. Obvious examples include giving up a habit such as a favorite food, sleeping in, or late-night TV&#x2014;but what happens when you try to give up your sins while recognizing the deeper reasons you commit them in the first place? By seeing those connections and praying specifically for God's insight, healing, and revelation, you&#x2019;ll be able to experience God&#x2019;s mercy and love to a greater capacity.<br><br> Kniepmann helps you see how the depth of Catholic teaching is connected to your daily life. Sin isn't just an activity; it is a place of the heart (the interior life) and the movement of the heart (toward or away from sin) as related to thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. By the time Easter arrives, you'll possess a deeper understanding of sin and emotional wounds as impediments to intimacy with God and come away with tangible, practical tools for addressing those impediments in your life.</p><p><b>Ken Kniepmann</b> is a Catholic speaker, writer and former executive director of the John Paul II Healing Center in Tallahassee, Florida, where he continues to serve in a variety of organizational and ministry capacities.

Dr. Kruger charts a course from the Trinity to the incarnation to the union of humanity with God in Jesus Christ. In that light he offers a breathtaking interpretation of our human existence as participation in the life of the Father, Son and Spirit. He uncovers the untold dignity of our ordinary humanity--from motherhood to baseball, from relationships and music to golf, gardening and designing lakes. This is a book about who we are and why we are here and what is really happening in our lives. Step by step, Dr. Kruger walks us through the stratagems of evil and the messes we make of our lives. More important, he explains why we hurt, what we are really after and how to get there, and why faith in Jesus Christ is so critical for abundant life. The Great Dance is theology at its very best--steeped in tradition, yet unfamiliar and exciting, even revolutionary; deeply personal and honest, yet universally relevant. Written with pace and poetry and winsome grace, The Great Dance is the voice of the ancient church speaking to us across the ages through the pen of a Southerner who loves life.

Lie back. If you want to stay out here with us, you need to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>Drest crept around the fire to Nutkin, Gobin&#x2019;s twin, who lay in almost the same position, except it was his hand, not arm, that held back his black hair.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not awake, either,&#x201d; Nutkin said, a smile tweaking his lips.</p><p>&#x201c;We come home from war and you&#x2019;re jumping at every sound,&#x201d; muttered Uwen, her youngest brother. &#x201c;Go to sleep, you crab-headed squid gut, or I&#x2019;ll make you sleep in the cave with the snails.&#x201d;</p><p>Drest crawled back to the water&#x2019;s edge. The sea was quiet. The night mist had swept in again. She listened, unmoving, the wind&#x2019;s fingers riffling her short and uneven brown hair.</p><p>Grimbol, her father, had always said that no boat or ship could reach their tight, protected cove, that the dragons&#x2019; teeth&#x2014;the stones scattered over the harbor&#x2014;were hungry for wood and men. And no man or devil would dare draw near the headland while her brothers and father were home.</p><p>Yet something was there.</p><p>Drest left the circle by the fire where her family slept and scrambled up the boulders behind the camp. She climbed over the crumbling stones, dead tree roots, and clumps of gorse, past the crag that looked over the spot of rocky beach where her brothers kept their boats, then higher, until she came to a point where the sea opened up before the headland. Above her rose the path to the cliffs. Behind her lay the caves where her family kept their supplies and slept when it rained. Over the water, the ash-gray fog stretched like smoke. Drest closed her eyes and listened.</p><p>Waves, sloshing.</p><p>The wind, gently breathing.</p><p>Her father and brothers, snoring from below.</p><p>A creak.</p><p>Not just a creak, but a scrape as well, the rasp of wood on stone in the cove just past the dragons&#x2019; teeth. She knew that sound: a boat. And it was landing.</p><p>Drest flew down the uneven cliff side, blind in the darkness but knowing her way. She pounded back into the camp toward the glow of the bonfire, and dropped to her knees beside her eldest brother.</p><p>&#x201c;Wulfric, there&#x2019;s a boat in the water!&#x201d;</p><p>Wulfric opened his eyes a crack. &#x201c;What are you saying, lass?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A boat. Like one of yours! Lads, get up!&#x201d;</p><p>Heads rose around her. Her father turned over with a growl.</p><p>&#x201c;Our poor wee Drest&#x2019;s had a nightmare,&#x201d; murmured Thorkill, fingering the stone pendant he wore below his curly ginger beard. &#x201c;Was it Gobin&#x2019;s battle story that kept you awake, lass?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nay, it&#x2019;s not that! I heard a boat.&#x201d; Drest stood, wincing at her brothers&#x2019; shaking heads. &#x201c;Lads, I <i>saw</i> it!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your grub-spotted nightmares to yourself,&#x201d; Uwen mumbled from beside the fire.</p><p>Her brothers settled down again, grunting and grumbling, until she was standing alone.</p><p>&#x201c;Why won&#x2019;t you listen? Do I ever tell stories? Lads, there&#x2019;s a <i>boat</i> out there.&#x201d;</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Drest opened her mouth, but before she could say anything more, the camp was bright with flames.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER 2: INVADERS</p><p>They rushed from the shadows, men with massive swords and gleaming shields, their bucket-shaped helms hiding their faces.</p><p>Drest&#x2019;s brothers always slept beside their weapons, and were up and armed in seconds, but the invaders had gained an advantage. Nutkin ducked behind the fire and slid to avoid a blade. Wulfric fought from his knees and battered away the enemy who had fallen upon him. Shields crashed together. Swords shrieked against chain mail.</p><p>In the middle of it stood Drest, far from her practice sword on the other side of the fire.</p><p>A knight dropped his sword and slumped against her. Drest scrambled out from under him, and slammed into another knight&#x2019;s shield, emblazoned with a tree, just like Wulfric&#x2019;s battered one. Drest ducked, twisted, and crawled away. On the loose rocks by the path, she panted. She had never seen a battle, and the sight of it squeezed like an iron band around her chest.</p><p>An unfamiliar grasp clamped onto her shoulder.</p><p>Drest gave a cry and tried to plunge back into the fight, but an arm gleaming with chain mail grabbed her around the waist and dragged her away, up the path. She lashed out, kicking nothing but rocks and air.</p><p>Her captor stumbled. Drest clawed at the stones, then at the hilt of a sword someone had dropped. Her fingers closed on the grip and she swung the blade back. A heavy note rang low and muted against the mail on the man&#x2019;s legs.</p><p>&#x201c;So even a wee wolf like you has teeth.&#x201d; The knight swung down his shield, knocking Drest&#x2019;s sword from her hand.</p><p>She kicked, a hopeless gesture. Yet not futile: Her long legs tangled with the invader&#x2019;s, tripping him&#x2014;and then she was rolling on the ground.</p><p>A different arm&#x2014;just flesh this time&#x2014;hooked around her ribs and hoisted her up. Drest struggled, but her new captor held her tightly and sprang over the stones, higher and higher, on a path that only her family would have known.</p><p>&#x201c;Get out of here, Drest.&#x201d; Her father&#x2019;s grizzled face looked down into hers. &#x201c;Make yourself scarce. Don&#x2019;t come out unless I call or until the headland&#x2019;s deserted. Understand? No fighting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Da, what about Uwen?&#x201d; Her voice came out cowering. Drest cleared her throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m his battle-mate, am I not? How will he fight without me at his back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you down there.&#x201d; Grimbol&#x2019;s powerful hand cradled his daughter&#x2019;s chin. &#x201c;In a fight like this, your battle-mate is the man next to you. And I must be the man next to any of my lads who needs my help. Hide yourself, Drest. Do as I say. You&#x2019;re part of the war-band now and that&#x2019;s my order.&#x201d;</p><p>An enemy&#x2019;s sword rose behind him. Grimbol ducked and kicked, sending the knight crashing down the path, then plunged after him, back to the fight.</p><p>Holding in a sob, Drest scurried up the uneven cliff side, her father&#x2019;s frantic order forcing her on.</p><p>She reached a spot where the sea opened up beyond the cliffs, and stopped. Terror spread over her shoulders like a new skin.</p><p>She belonged with Uwen. They weren&#x2019;t ready to fight together, had not perfected Gobin and Nutkin&#x2019;s speed and precision or Wulfric and Thorkill&#x2019;s brute force, but they had achieved a point of trust where they could shuttle courage back and forth. That was the first and most important part of being a true battle-mate, her father always said. It was also the first rule of her father&#x2019;s code of life and war.</p><p>Yet Drest could not move, not for the world.</p><p>She bowed her head. Uwen had to be safe. Their brothers were with him. The war-band had always returned after battles, sometimes wounded but never gravely so. They would win this attack. They always won.</p><p>They had to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drest climbed higher, wind gusts whipping at her tunic, until she reached the path to the sea cliffs, the highest point of the headland. On one side, the ravine and its forest loomed, a wall of darkness; on the other crashed the sea. Drest walked along the sea edge, careful to keep far from the ravine. Four years ago, Uwen had fallen there, and crashed to the bottom. It had been a game of chase and they&#x2019;d been alone, with the war-band away at battle. It had taken a wee Drest hours to drag her brother up through the spindly trees and loose soil.</p><p>At the cluster of rocks that looked like a crouching knight when the sun was low, she curled up, as if she were small again and playing a hiding game with Uwen.</p><p>As still as stone, Drest listened for the sound of her father&#x2019;s voice. All she could hear from that height was the slosh of the sea.</p><p>A whole night seemed to pass as Drest waited, and still her father did not call. She was shifting her position, wondering what she would do if he never called, when another sound came: footsteps against the loose rocks close by.</p><p>She almost stood, but stopped herself in time.</p><p>A tongue of torchlight had appeared on the path.</p><p>Drest ducked. None of her family would carry a torch. She slid down until she found a crack in the stones, and set her eye to it.</p><p>Like phantoms from a nightmare, two men in chain mail and white surcoats with a blue tree in the center stepped out of the night fog, their swords glittering in their hands. One was thinner, smaller, and clearly younger, but both reeked of power.</p><p>They advanced toward the clump of rocks as if they knew where she was hiding. At the dip in the path where Uwen had tripped, the smaller knight walked on, but the larger one, who carried the torch, stepped in it and stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;This is where you must stay.&#x201d; The larger knight pivoted his back to the cavernous ravine and held his torch to illuminate the cliff before the sea. His face seemed flushed within his chain mail hood. &#x201c;The ship will wait there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was so close to their camp,&#x201d; the younger knight insisted. He was slender, as wiry as Gobin, with a piece of fair hair sticking out from his chain mail hood. &#x201c;Why did you keep me from it? Why bring me up here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you are young and untested. Sir Oswyn said&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I wish to see the battle!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And have the Wolf come down on you with all his might?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think I can&#x2019;t defend myself?&#x201d; The young knight raised his sword and shield. &#x201c;Will it make you feel better if I brandish these?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll trip over the rocks more likely,&#x201d; muttered the red-faced knight. &#x201c;Let me scout. I&#x2019;ll be back faster than you&#x2019;ll know.&#x201d;</p><p>Grumbling, the young knight set the tip of his long shield against the stone and leaned upon it. Soon the torchlight disappeared as the red-faced knight strode down the path.</p><p>The young man sighed and shrugged. All at once, his shield slipped. With a clatter and scrape, he caught his balance.</p><p>&#x201c;God&#x2019;s bones,&#x201d; he swore softly.</p><p>He could have been Gobin playing a joke, pretending to be clumsy. Or maybe he <i>was</i> clumsy, as Uwen could be in their practice battles.</p><p>Or he was frightened, just as Drest was as she crouched behind the stones.</p><p>She knew what would happen next. The red-faced knight would return and tell the young knight that the path was safe. They would approach the camp. They would step into someone&#x2019;s sword&#x2014;Wulfric&#x2019;s or Thorkill&#x2019;s, or even her father&#x2019;s. The red-faced knight might run, but this one, this clumsy, frightened knight, would join the other knights who lay upon the ground.</p><p>And because he made her think of Gobin, Drest sighed.</p><p>The young knight flinched. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;</p><p>Drest froze. He had heard her.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there, I said.&#x201d;</p><p>But he wasn&#x2019;t speaking to Drest.</p><p>In a blur, a dark figure sprang toward him from the path, sword aloft in his hand. The young knight raised his shield. But the dark figure&#x2019;s shield struck it hard, and then his sword swung around and landed a solid blow upon the smaller man&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>It was as if Uwen were battling Wulfric. And there was no room behind the smaller man to retreat, not on the edge of the ravine.</p><p>The dark figure&#x2019;s sword struck again. The young knight escaped the full force of the blow to his shoulder, ducking and pivoting, but his heel landed in the dip in the path.</p><p>His attacker seemed to know that. He threw his shield against his opponent&#x2019;s. The young knight dropped his sword. His hand flew to his belt, as if for a dagger.</p><p>But he had lost his balance and his attacker had already pulled back.</p><p>The young knight disappeared into the ravine in a sliding, scraping, crumbling rush of stone. Tree branches snapped, and leaves rattled. Then all was silent.</p><p>The attacker rocked back on his heels and waited. He cleared his throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you there?&#x201d; he called.</p><p>The voice stopped Drest cold.</p><p>It was the red-faced knight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER 3: GRIMBOL�S ORDER</p><p>The red-faced knight picked up the young knight&#x2019;s sword and, with a grunt, threw it toward the sea. There was a clatter, then a muted splash. The knight nodded and descended the path toward the camp.</p><p>Trembling, Drest rose. The fight she had witnessed made no sense. In her father&#x2019;s stories about the knights he had known, they had never battled among themselves.</p><p>Drest slipped out from her hiding place and crouched on her hands and knees, leaning into the ravine to listen.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He was just a lad. He&#x2019;d been scared in the dark, then attacked by one of his war-band. Now he lay dead at the bottom of the ravine.</p><p>She heard the red-faced knight stumble and swear.</p><p>A thin curl of hate rose in Drest. Silent as a ghost, she hastened after him.</p><p>Just below the cliff, he stopped to don his white surcoat, then strode on.</p><p>The sky had lightened, though the path was still shadowed. Drest hoped the red-faced knight would trip.</p><p>But the red-faced knight didn&#x2019;t trip. He veered off to the side, shoving his way through scrub and over stones until he was far from the camp and close to a drop at the sea. Drest followed him on this new, narrow trail.</p><p>All at once, the red-faced knight disappeared ahead of her.</p><p>Metal rasped against stone. Boots scraped. Paddles splashed in the sea.</p><p>A small boat rowed away from the shore toward a huge boat emerging from the darkness.</p><p>Drest stared. She had never seen a full ship, only the small war-boats her father and brothers sailed when they went to battle.</p><p>Waves slapped against its huge wooden hull. A massive white sail hung limp in the breeze. A series of posts stood on its deck.</p><p>Not posts, Drest realized, but knights: a dozen knights with swords and shields, chain mail covering their arms and heads. One knight stood beside a coil of rope.</p><p>Yet it wasn&#x2019;t just rope.</p><p>Drest froze.</p><p>In that coil, her father and brothers were bound: Grimbol lashed to Wulfric, their backs aligned; Gobin and Nutkin with their heads touching; Thorkill bound to Uwen, his broad shoulders towering over his younger brother&#x2019;s. Grimbol&#x2019;s mouth was moving.</p><p>The small boat drew near the ship and the red-faced knight climbed aboard. He spoke to another knight and looked around as if counting. The others were looking too. Drest was so intent on watching that she failed to notice where she stood. Only when the red-faced knight pointed at her did she realize that she was out in the open.</p><p>Drest scrambled back over the crumbling stone, then behind a boulder that was just large enough to hide her.</p><p>&#x201c;You missed one!&#x201d; shouted the red-faced knight in a brutal voice very different from the soft voice he had used with the young knight. &#x201c;How did you miss one?&#x201d;</p><p>A murmur rose from the bound men. Drest looked out. Her brothers twisted around to see her, their faces tight with concern.</p><p>Grimbol raised his chin. &#x201c;Be like the barnacl...</p></p><h2>Hina (Hawaiian Legends for Little Ones)</h2><p>Part of a new series called Hawaiian Legends for Little Ones, Hina introduces kids ages 0-4 to one of Hawaii&#39;s best-known dieties, the goddess of the moon.

Drawn from the Commission&#39;s own collection of hearings and exhibits, plus thousands of pages of unindexed documents, this evidence decisively refutes the Warren Commission&#39;s theory of Oswald as lone assassin. By applying the Commission&#39;s own evidence to the key issues of the case, supplemented by the evidence collected by subsequent government panels, The JFK Assassination Evidence Handbook shows beyond a reasonable doubt that at least three assassins targeted President Kennedy in Dallas, that Lee Oswald was not one of the shooters, that Oswald had associations not only with U. S. intelligence, but also with organized crime, that the Dallas police department provided false police radio transcripts to the Commission, that Officer J. D. Tippit&#39;s movements following the assassination raise the suspicion he was hunting for Oswald in order to silence him, and that the police department&#39;s handling of the forensic evidence was so sloppy that massive falsification and substitution of evidence against Oswald cannot be ruled out. These and many other new revelations are concisely presented and meticulously documented with numerous references to the source documents. This major addition to the assassination literature is an essential reference work and an indispensable guide for defenders of the conspiracist position. No serious student of the Kennedy assassination can afford to be without The JFK Assassination Evidence Handbook.</p><p></p><h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Mad Mage's Academy: An Endless Quest Book</h2><p><b>Welcome to the Forgotten Realms Endless Quest books, where you don&#x2019;t just read a fantastic tale.

In brief, lyrical text, Rylant states that snow helps us notice "the delicate limbs of trees" and "the light falling from a lamppost." It brings the delight of making snow angels and sledding and returning home to enjoy a warm drink. She urges readers to savor the phenomenon, for it remains only briefly. Stringer's acrylic paintings make use of small boxed scenes, full and three-quarter spreads, or full-page pictures framed in white, to display a world of snow-filled wonders. Varying perspectives help readers come up close to a group of multiethnic children gazing longingly at the flakes falling outside their classroom window and then view them from above as, clad in their puffy winter gear, they are finally released to cavort in its depths. There are interior views of a grandparent and child enjoying cozy activities at home and exterior scenes of the two enjoying a walk as twilight bathes the snow in pink hues.

But a school competition soon helps him to find his own very special talent ! Children with Dyslexia or a learning difficulty often find school a daunting and sometimes terrifying daily task. In an environment where certain skills, like writing and reading, are praised and highlighted more than others, it is important for children to recognise that everyone has a &#39;special talent&#39; of their own. It encourages other children to be mindful of the differences that exist between their friends and classmates and to be aware that all children, regardless of their talents, learn differently.</p><p>I first began work on 'the special stories series 1' in 2005. Drawing from the personal experiences of friends, relatives and healthcare professionals for my inspiration, it took me over a year to write the full set. My mother worked as a social worker for over twenty years in foster care, adoption and child protection. So even from a young age I was always very conscious of the struggles of children at risk. Now, with my own friends working as play therapists, social workers and teachers the need for suitable literature for very young children became even more apparent. Before writing the series I spoke to a number of professionals working with children on a daily basis. I discovered that many were being forced to use sub-standard and inappropriate material, totally unsuitable for young children considering the sensitive subjects they were dealing with. The objective behind the Special Stories Series was that children would no longer have to contend with leaflets and dreary booklets to help explain such sensitive issues as those address in the Special Stories books. Instead they could hear the story of a child in a similar situation to their own, with language they could understand, illustrated in a vivid and colourful way. This in turn would make it easier for a parent or professional to discuss their situation and any feelings of anxiety that their child might have. Through Special Stories Publishing, I look forward to creating many more books in the same genre as the current set, dealing with topics such as bullying, parental separation, healthy eating and illness/death of a parent or sibling. My hope is that books from Special Stories Publishing will help to normalize rather than ostracise these issues for young children in classrooms, families and cr�&#x192;¨ches throughout Ireland, the UK and the rest of the world.

The homilies he gave had the special ability of converting those who had fallen away from the faith. He also founded the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, and authored such works as <i>The Glories of Mary</i>, <i>The True Spouse of Jesus Christ</i>, <i>Attaining Salvation</i>, <i>The Blessed Virgin Mary</i>, <i>Preparation for Death Abridged</i>, <i>What Will Hell Be Like?</i>, <i>The Twelve Steps to Holiness and Salvation</i>, and <i>The Way of the Cross</i>.<br><br> After being a bishop for over a decade, St. Alphonsus Liguori died on the first of August, 1787.

Probably better than good.<br><br>I want you to let that sink in. I meet so many parents who beat themselves up because they believe they are letting their children down with their failures. The baby cried all night and they couldn't figure out why. One day they were too demanding, another day they were too lax. They have been known to heat a box of frozen fish sticks for supper. They have yet to chaperone a single field trip. So many are carrying around an image of the perfect parent and are painfully aware that they're not one. My hope is that by the time you're done with this book, you'll be okay with that.<br><br>The goal of this book isn't to make you a perfect parent. It's to make you a more optimistic, confident, lighthearted, and fearless one. It's for anyone who has ever felt stressed out, strung out, anxious, exhausted, frustrated, or flummoxed by the challenges and pressures of parenting young children and who believes this is the normal, unavoidable face of parenting today. I assure you it is not. Many of the parents I have spoken with around the world are just as busy and just as invested in their children as we are, yet I have rarely heard them express the complete exhaustion and frustration that is such a regular complaint for the parents I have met in my pediatric clinics in Colorado, Idaho, and other parts of the United States. And it isn't just because their governments provide social services like ample paid parental leave, free childcare, and universal preschool, although those benefits help tremendously. As I see it, the big differences between these populations and the average American parent seems to be simply that those parents aren't judged for putting their own needs on par with their children's, and they don't spend time worrying about what everyone else thinks or what they could be doing more or better. Free of that mental anguish and second-guessing, they seem better able to project a calm, positive, relaxed attitude. While some families and cultures are stricter than others, in general I have found that parents living in or hailing from many other parts of the world seem to have a more optimistic outlook, firmly believing that with a stable environment and a nurturing family, the kids really will be all right. The end result of this approach is not only happy, healthy kids, but also happy, healthy parents.<br><br>Why is this confident, laissez-faire parenting philosophy in such short supply in our country? It has been squelched by a culture of fear, one that gleefully finds new ways to scare parents every day and lays the responsibility for their child's every triumph and failure right at their feet. There are of course those who try to buck the trend by instilling independence in their children at an early age, letting them make mistakes, or simply refusing to be afraid, but they are increasingly taking a risk. Many find themselves judged harshly by their peers or, worse, confronted by Child Protective Services, such as the Austin woman whose neighbor had her investigated for child abuse after she allowed her six-year-old son to play outdoors unsupervised within view of his own front porch, and the Maryland couple charged with "unsubstantiated child endangerment" for allowing their six- and ten-year-olds to walk home alone from a neighborhood park.<br><br>You would be hard-pressed to find any American who would disagree that it is the parents' job to protect their children from any risk or danger, that children's outdoor activities must be monitored to keep them safe, that parents must assess and encourage their children's gifts and talents early or risk squandering their child's potential, or that parents must be actively engaged with their children's schools and academic life. To buck these "rules" is to be irresponsible, even negligent. And they sound reasonable. Yet upholding these high standards requires a level of time, commitment, and effort that was never expected of generations past. For many parents, especially mothers, the demands-and the guilt and anxiety that arise when they can't meet those demands-can be overwhelming, leading to stress, exhaustion, and depression. Now, if extreme caution and vigilance resulted in the healthiest, most well-adjusted kids on the planet, maybe one could make the argument that parental happiness really should be secondary to the success of the child. But the facts don't support that theory at all.<br><br>Much has been written about how our American form of fear-based parenting is leading to epidemic levels of stress and anxiety, making mothers (and many fathers) feel crazy and miserable, but so far, knowing that anxiety is deleterious to our health hasn't been enough to force us to change our parenting approach. But maybe this will: There is ample evidence that the way we parent today isn't just hurting us-it's hurting our growing children, physically and cognitively. In the United States, we have seen<br><br>a 600 percent increase since 1992 in the rates of full-term babies suffering from flat head syndrome, many by their two-month well-child visit, which over time can result in cognitive delays and visual impairment as well as other medical problems.<br><br>1 in 68 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder<br><br>1 in 8 children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder<br><br>increased rates of asthma<br><br>a 50 percent increase in ADHD diagnoses for school-aged children since 2003<br><br>increased levels of juvenile depression, even in children with good self-control and emotional awareness<br><br>a 35 percent increase of type 2 diabetes and hypertension in youth aged ten to nineteen between 2001-2009, diagnoses almost never seen in pediatric age groups until recently<br><br>Curiously, "all-in" parenting and making safety our number one priority isn't making our kids emotionally or physically healthier. And similar consequences are being felt in other countries, like England and Canada, that are adopting our parenting standards and habits. In this book we'll explore how the stress and fear we invite on ourselves can exacerbate or even set the stage for these conditions in our kids.<br><br>We don't even have to look for extreme symptoms to see the damage our over-involvement and heightened state of anxiety can cause. I saw it in my office every day. So do parents, they just don't realize it. It often manifests itself in the form of babies who won't sleep through the night, toddlers who won't eat balanced meals, young children prone to temper tantrums and separation anxiety, and older children who resist discipline. Parents are assured that children are biologically wired to behave this way; that daily struggles, screaming matches, and stress are natural parts of family life. But if that were the case, parents around the world would be wrestling with these issues as frequently as we do. Yet you rarely see Asian or Scandinavian toddlers having temper tantrums. Few Indian children turn their nose up at their vegetables. It's unusual for parents in Holland or France to spend months in a row tending to their wailing infants or restless toddlers. Are American babies and children somehow physiologically different from others? Of course not. The truth is that much of the time, these "inevitable" issues are in fact quite preventable and more likely caused by environmental and cultural factors than by biological ones.<br><br>Through my travels and conversations, I have found that parents hailing from or living in countries that report high levels of parental satisfaction and family harmony embrace a number of principles that may seem counterintuitive and even shocking to many American parents:<br><br>1. It is not natural for mothers to be with their young children all day and night.<br><br>2. Nurturing a marriage or partnership is as important to child-rearing as nurturing the child.<br><br>3. Children are strong and resilient-unless parents teach them not to be.<br><br>4. Sometimes a parent's needs must come first.<br><br>5. Picky eating is learned, not innate.<br><br>6. There is such a thing as being too careful.<br><br>7. Raising successful children is about providing interaction, not just opportunities.<br><br>These are the principles that underlie much of the advice I have offered the families in my practice over the years and the ones that have seemed to make the most positive difference in their lives by preventing or reversing almost every typical early-childhood challenge, from colic to sleep resistance, from tantrums to separation anxiety.<br><br>A Problem That Transcends Class<br><br>The knee-jerk reaction to any critique of the perfectionist pressure put on American mothers in particular and parents in general is that it is a problem for only a certain upwardly mobile, affluent demographic that has the time to wring its hands over such things. But this phenomenon is no longer limited to upper-middle-class white families, if it ever really was. I have served a broad swath of American families, from the relatively homogenous families in northwest Colorado to the urban and ethnically diverse communities in North Carolina to isolated, rural Idaho where 40 percent of the population was on Medicaid. I have treated the children of well-off professionals, middle-class couples, teen moms, and recovering meth addicts. Most of the parents I meet adore parenthood and describe this time as one of unbelievable love and joy. But across the board, they often qualify that description by adding that it is also a time of unbelievable anxiety, stress, and even exhaustion. Many even wear their fatigue and stress as a badge of honor. After all, no one said parenting would be easy, and everyone knows it takes sacrifice and hard work to raise a well-adjusted, healthy child.<br><br>But should it? Is it a universal given that good parents should be willing to give up just about anything for the benefit of their children or that good parenting is inherently stressful? As this book will show, no. Parents in many other countries juggle work and children. They want what's best for their kids. And of course they sometimes worry. But they are not consumed by it because unlike us, they are not bombarded with the message that parenthood is a trial, that childhood is a dangerous time for children, and that anything could happen at any time to destroy their happiness. It's often a subtle narrative, but we hear it all the time, and it is constantly reinforced by the multitude of rules we've developed to stave off our worst nightmares.<br><br>Rules Made to Be Broken<br><br>Nothing makes a risk-averse society feel better than a nice list of rules. Parents love them. Rules take all the guesswork out of decision making, offering parents a few moments of respite in a job that requires endless improvisation. They also give us an immediate way to categorize ourselves and other parents: Those who follow the rules are "good" parents; those who break them out of willfulness or ignorance are "bad," or at the very least, irresponsible.<br><br>I have a strong aversion to too many rules, especially when it comes to raising children. With the exception of the ones grounded in physiological facts, rules are generally culturally biased, and therefore completely subjective. For example, many Americans were appalled by the story of the Kaufmans, a young couple raising their one- and three-year-old daughters on a sailboat while embarking on a round-the-world trip, only to be rescued by the Coast Guard when they lost control of the boat and their younger daughter fell ill. In blogs and comments, people accused the Kaufmans of selfishness, negligence, and child endangerment. Because we live in a society that aspires to a certain level of material comfort and has established that children should be raised on terra firma, to many, the Kaufmans' actions seemed inexplicable and dangerous. They broke the rules, and many people thought they should pay.<br><br>And yet, families take their children on adventurous trips all the time-we just don't hear about them because the media aren't all that interested in family success stories. And really, their decision wasn't that wild, globally speaking. The Bajau-Laut and the Moken people of Southeast Asia raise their children in boats or in homes built over the water, and you won't find a life preserver anywhere. The Korowai tribe of New Guinea lives in tree houses, sometimes perched up to 150 feet off the ground. Does the fact that the Moken and the Korowai have different safety standards mean that families who sail should leave the lifejackets behind or that apartment dwellers with children should forgo window guards? Of course not. (The Korowai are said to still practice cannibalism, too, so they're not necessarily role models.) But clearly, with proper planning and preparation, humans can adapt to almost any living environment. The rules governing the "right" way to raise and care for children are far more flexible than people realize.<br><br>You might be surprised at how many rules invoked in the name of safety, and accepted by many American parents as dogma, are unheard of or taken with a grain of salt in other countries. For example, this one, emblazoned in big block letters on the label of every jar of honey sold in this country: Babies under a year old shouldn't eat honey. Everyone knows that, right? Yet around the world, in places like Greece, New Zealand, France, and the Middle East, parents feed it to their young children without a moment's thought, often mixed in dairy products or drizzled on toast or fruit. Is there something different about the honey they feed their children? Are our children particularly vulnerable to illness in ways that children in other countries are not? Not at all. The reason we see this stringent warning repeated over and over again is because at one point back in the 1970s, California saw a few cases of infant botulism, which is extremely rare. Later, researchers found traces of botulism spores in some samples of honey. Thus the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set the recommendation that parents avoid feeding honey to infants, whose gastrointestinal tracts are incapable of handling any botulism spores that might be present. Botulism, especially in a small infant, can be deadly. It's not a trivial matter. But let's put things in perspective:<br><br>On average, there are only 80 to 100 cases of infant botulism reported in the United States per year out of approximately 4 million births per year. Of those cases, only about 20 percent are related to honey.<br><br>Botulism spores can be found in dirt, water, and dust, including the dust from your vacuum cleaner.</p><h2>Temptations: Revised and Update</h2><p>Williams, a founding member of the legendary Motown group the Temptations, tells the story of the group&#39;s formation and its years of musical success.</p><p>Otis Williams is a founding member of the original Temptations, as well as its only surviving member. He lives in Woodland Hills, CA, near Los Angeles. Patricia Romanowski co-wrote <i>Supreme Faith</i> with Mary Wilson. She lives in Baldwin, Long Island, NY.With Romanowski, coauthor of Vanna Speaks , Williams, founder of the Temptations, a blues group that sang its way to the top of the charts in the 1960s, tells a vivid story of good times and bad: Motown's super group has been plagued by violent quarrels, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide. The Temptations have often been on the verge of falling apart, but Williams, according to the authors, has always been able to pull them together again, even to pick up the pieces of their troubled relationship with Motown founder Berry Gordy. Among other tidbits, the book provides illuminating insights into the famous "Motown U," where singers were instructed in charm and deportment as well as musical skills. The group is still going strong, though membership has changed over the years, and Williams writes as a man who is proud of having kept it alive for so long.

Who are you? What is your stage of life? What are your life circumstances? What is the cross you will have to bear? What are you afraid of? We ask these six critical questions&#x2015;and then we ask them again&#x2015;at points of transition in our lives. They all lead us to the one core question: What is the good work to which I am called? Gordon T. Smith, author of <em>Courage and Calling</em>, writes: "It is a good question because our work matters to us, to others and, of course, it matters to God. Work itself is good. It is vital to our human identity; and we are most ourselves, most who God calls us to be, living in what it means to know the salvation of God, when we know the grace of work well done." However, Smith acknowledges that this is not a simple question to answer in the midst of our very complicated lives. That's why he has written this brief and accessible book&#x2015;to offer the support and insight we need as we ponder these six core questions in community with God and others.

As we join together to explore with you the best parenting practices based on biblical insights and scientific research, the two of us&#x2014;one a Bible-based psychologist and the other a science-based marriage and family counselor&#x2014;draw not only on our more than fifty years of collective research and experience but also on the shared belief that faith and science can and must serve one another, especially where the development of children is concerned.<br><br><b>A Note from Dr. Gregg Jantz<br><br></b>Welcome to this book! I&#x2019;m so glad to be working with Michael and with you on this very important subject. I had been asked for a number of years if I would consider providing a book for parents who are raising Christian sons. As the father of two sons and a professional who has worked with young males for decades, I wanted to write that book. My research and clinical practice has constantly brought me into the lives of boys and their families, and the wisdom I&#x2019;ve gained from these young people and families has inspired me to look deeply into the available research on male development in both religious and secular contexts.<br><br>As part of that journey, I met Michael&#x2014;initially through his book <i>The Wonder of Boys </i>and then personally when I attended the Gurian Institute Summer Training Program at the University of Colorado&#x2013;Colorado Springs. As he presented his findings, I was immediately moved by the fact that his science-based theory coincided in many ways with my own theoretical and clinical work in helping the families of boys and girls. Not too long after our meeting, the two of us became friends and started sharing our perspectives. I soon began considering how I might partner with him to bring our intersecting theories, research, and practical strategies front and center into the Christian world. That Michael is a practicing Jew and a man of deep spiritual commitment helped me to immediately feel comfortable with him.<br><br>As the two of us compared notes, I learned that Michael, too, had been asked to write a purposeful resource for Christian parents.<br><br><b>Michael&#x2019;s Story<br></b><br>I join Gregg in welcoming you into this book and its passionate journey! It is an honor to walk with Gregg and Ann in helping you raise your sons.<br><br>Much of my career has been devoted to working with parents, teachers, and organizations to integrate science-based research into their lives. As a clinician and counselor, I&#x2019;ve also worked hard to help bridge gaps between religion and science. Part of this intention grows from my Christian clients and readers. In my office, in e-mails, or after lectures, they have asked things like, &#x201c;Can you put together your science- based research with the Bible?&#x201d; &#x201c;Would you consider writing a Bible-oriented book for Christian parents?&#x201d; &#x201c;Is there a God-given design to males and females?&#x201d;<br><br>The questions I&#x2019;ve received that relate to Bible-based parenting were not questions I had the expertise to answer, but the concept of &#x201c;God-given design&#x201d; is, I believe, a profoundly important concept to consider. In the early 1990s, from a secular perspective, I coined the phrase &#x201c;nature-based theory&#x201d; to reflect the fact that gender, personality, talent sets, and many other aspects of human development do indeed possess a &#x201c;nature&#x201d; component (we will look in detail at the scientific studies behind this assertion in chapter 2).<br><br>Male and female natures (gender) begin in our genetics, before birth, and we carry those natural gender proclivities (what are called, in developmental science, &#x201c;biological tendencies&#x201d;) with us throughout our lives. So while each boy and each girl, each woman and each man is influenced significantly by nurture and culture, each gender comes into the world with some profound gender differences in tow.<br><br>As I met with Gregg, I heard him using the terms &#x201c;God-given design&#x201d; and &#x201c;parenting with God&#x2019;s design.&#x201d; His theories provided a meeting point with nature- based theory and science-based parenting. We realized that the phrase &#x201c;design-based parenting&#x201d; integrated our common themes. As we developed this book, we found significant intersections between the Bible and brain science.<br><br>Our bridge building between the Bible and science feels to me like not only a powerful and positive resource for parents and others caring for children but also a way for faith-based and secular worlds to work together to deepen our human conversation regarding the lives of our precious children.<br><br><b>Our Team and Your Team<br></b><br>Together, as experts from two different worlds, we are excited to provide this leading-edge resource for Christian parents.

We also want to thank the Gurian Institute team in Colorado and elsewhere in the country and give special thanks to Rev. Tim Wright in Peoria, Arizona, for his expertise in matters regarding boys and church life.<br><br>Our two teams join us in hoping that the practices in this book will help you gift your son and family with an approach to parenting that brings together the best of the contemporary scientific world with the abiding truths of ancient wisdom.<br><br><b>1: Our Sons Need a New Approach to Boyhood<br><br></b><i>We live in a culture that has forgotten many crucial aspects of the divine design at work in the body and soul of boyhood.<br><br></i>They come into the world red-faced, sometimes screaming at the top of their lungs. With the joyous pronouncement, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a boy!&#x201d; our sons are celebrated. Into their tiny bodies we stuff our hopes and dreams as parents. As we gaze at their faces, we see our fathers and mothers, our grandmothers and grandfathers gazing back at us. Though our new son is barely a part of our present, we look at his squirming, warm bundle of future potential and say to ourselves, &#x201c;Hello, little man.&#x201d; Little do we know the adventure we are beginning! Our sons grow and change, sometimes before our eyes, and we can barely keep up with their active, inquisitive natures. We seek to mold their wills to our own without breaking that spirit we know they will need in order to become a man.<br><br>And we worry what sort of men they will become. Will they be strong enough to shoulder an adult load? Will they be humble enough to learn the lessons we yearn to teach? In a culture where the rules for manhood don&#x2019;t always align with our values, whose wisdom will they listen to and follow? We watch our sons change and mature. We watch them succeed, and we watch them fail. Knowing they must someday take over their own lives, we wonder how much to intervene. The line between too little help and too much help isn&#x2019;t always clear to parents of boys today. Our sons must learn to bear the weight of their thoughts and actions, but how much is too much and how soon is too soon?<br><br>It&#x2019;s difficult enough to deal with these questions and doubts when our sons are small and relatively contained under our roofs. When our sons enter preschool and then school, the circle of adults with input and opinions and responsibility over our sons expands. Our choices and decisions and the conduct of our sons come under review. The schoolhouse is just one place where our parenting and the character of our sons can come into question. As you notice your son measuring the world and being measured by it, you may feel that now is the time to fully embrace the complexity of raising boys in this busy, challenging world. Now is the time to take a journey into the divine design of your son.<br><br><b>Boys Need to Know They&#x2019;re Made in God&#x2019;s Image<br></b><br>For me (Gregg), schooling is what challenged my family and me to look at the divine design of boys. In grade school and even through middle school, I often found myself bored and unmotivated, trapped in a curricular purgatory of meaningless worksheets and monotone lectures. I (and therefore my parents) would get comments from teachers such as &#x201c;Gregg is disruptive in class&#x201d; and &#x201c;Gregg is not working up to his potential.&#x201d; After many discipline referrals to the principal, I finally learned to play the game. I was mentored in how to power through the tedium of what I was expected to do so I could finally get to what I wanted to do. And contrary to some of the dire predictions prophesied to my parents and teachers over those early years, I actually did graduate high school and even went on to earn my doctorate.<br><br>As I established my career, I thought I had put all of that early anxiety and struggle behind me. Imagine my surprise when many of those feelings came flooding back as my sons began their schooling. Through my sons&#x2019; eyes, I realized that not much had changed since I&#x2019;d been in school. The tipping point toward looking at the design of boys for the sake of my sons came soon after my oldest&#x2014;my namesake, Gregg-started sixth grade at a new school. One day he reported a weird thing that had caught his attention. At the start of each day, a line of boys paraded up to the teacher&#x2019;s desk and took some sort of pill. When he relayed this oddity, my heart sank. The only conclusion I could draw was these boys were being medicated, probably with Ritalin or a similar drug, probably for ADD or ADHD.<br><br>Not long after we learned this disturbing news, my wife and I were advised by school administrators to consider putting our son on medication as well. Hearing a recitation of what he was like to &#x201c;deal with&#x201d; in class was like reading over the comments on my own childhood report cards. Please hear me: As a seasoned counselor, I know that some children absolutely need medication to cope with very real issues. But I also know that medication is being overprescribed; far too many social systems today, while being truly devoted to helping children succeed, simply do not understand the way boys are designed.</p><h2>The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything . . .

Our marriages are lived the same way. Not anniversary to anniversary or even month to month, but daily&#x2014;in the ordinary ins and outs of time. The choices we make in the moments create the lives we enjoy&#x2014;or don&#x2019;t. Thus, a love and war devotional. This devotional is a tool for you, for your marriage. We invite you to walk alongside us for eight weeks&#x2014;five days a week&#x2014;and dive deeper into the tangible realities of your marriage. We&#x2019;ll focus on Scripture and the heart of God and the heart that he placed in you and the heart he has placed in your spouse.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey of our lives is a journey of transformation. We are here to learn how to love. How do we learn? Moment by moment. Day by day. Week by week. Our marriages grow and become what God intended and what we ultimately long for in the same way. We are all of us learning to love.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#x2019;s learn together.<br><b>DAY 1: Romance Meets Reality</b><br><br><i>We love because he first loved us.<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;1 JOHN 4:19<br><br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We probably ought to just start here: marriage is fabulously hard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe that&#x2019;s an odd way to begin, but it is <i>true</i>, and everybody who&#x2019;s been married knows this, though years into marriage it still catches us off guard, all of us. And newly married couples, when they discover how hard it is, seem genuinely surprised. Shocked and disheartened by the fact. <i>Are we doing something wrong? Did I marry the right person?</i> The wonders that lure us into marriage&#x2014;romance, love, passion, sex, longing, companionship&#x2014;sometimes seem so far from the actual reality of married life that we wind up fearing we&#x2019;ve made a colossal mistake, caught the wrong bus, missed our flight. And so the hardness of marriage can also come as something of an embarrassment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe it&#x2019;s just us. Don&#x2019;t you feel embarrassed to admit how hard your marriage is?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. This is everyone. We might as well come out and admit it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sooner we get that shame off our backs, the sooner we&#x2019;ll find our way through. Of course marriage is hard. In fact, if you look back at the first marriage, that fairy-tale start in Genesis, you see that Adam and Eve had a pretty rough go at it. And they didn&#x2019;t even have parents to screw them up as children or friends giving them ridiculous advice. The fall of man seems to come during the honeymoon or shortly thereafter. (And how many honeymoon stories seem to reenact that little drama?) They hit rough water as soon as they set sail. This is the story of the first marriage, and it&#x2019;s a bit sobering.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it also gives us some encouragement. It&#x2019;s normal for marriage to be hard. Even the best of marriages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God is in that.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to have the life we want, the life we are made for, and the marriage we long for, we need God. That&#x2019;s a very good thing! Because without him, nothing is as it should be. With him, all things are possible. Yes, marriage can be extremely hard. But that is not a reason to despair. Nor is it the final truth. There are seasons in marriage&#x2014;in every relationship. Marriage is meant to be wonderful, and most of the time it is. Though it&#x2019;s sometimes so hard, think of the difficulty as a doorway. A doorway to all the <i>more</i> Jesus has for us in himself ! There is hope!<br><br><i>Dear God, as I begin this study, I offer up this time for your purposes. Please help me draw closer to your heart and deepen my marriage in every good way. Sometimes it is very hard. Even painful. I invite you into that as well. Have your way with me, with my spouse, and with our marriage. We need you. I am looking to you. In Jesus&#x2019; mighty name, amen.<br></i><br>Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.

Her lectures and workshops on crafts and gardening delight audiences across the United States.Grade 4-8-Martin contends that nature provides us with an abundance of art supplies and she invites readers to make use of these bounties in these 65 projects. She classifies the activities according to the material required: vines, twigs, cones, and moss; gourds, pods, husks, and seeds; clay, stones, sand, and shells; paints, inks, and dyes; flowers and leaves; and stamps, stencils, molds, and seals. Each chapter includes information about historical and ethnic uses for the natural substances. Activities are rated by level of difficulty; all have easy-to-follow instructions. Projects range from baskets, picture frames, wreaths, necklaces, and gift wrap to body paint, amulet bags, and painted stones; from a chess set to shell buttons to an okra pod canoe and people. The projects display a respect for nature and art, and a simple, subtle beauty; they are not the cutesy, stylized projects described in so many contemporary books. Line drawings accompany the numbered steps and charming ink-and-watercolor pictures illustrate the completed projects. Some general crafting techniques are explained. The helpful appendix offers charts on the availability of various materials and their uses and gift suggestions. Bobbe Needham's Ecology Crafts for Kids (Sterling, 1998), which encourages the use of natural craft materials as well as recycled man-made materials, complements this title.

Scott Fitzgerald vacationed in the French Riviera, where a small green lighthouse winked at ships on the horizon. Before the nameless lovers began their illicit affair in <i>The Lover</i>, Marguerite Duras embarked upon her own scandalous relationship amidst the urban streets of Saigon. And before readers were terrified by a tentacled dragon-man called Cthulhu, H.P. Lovecraft was enthralled by the Industrial Trust tower-- the 26-story skyscraper that makes up the skyline of Providence, Rhode Island. <br> &nbsp;<br> Based on the popular <i>New York Times</i> travel column, <i>Footsteps</i> is an anthology of literary pilgrimages, exploring the geographic muses behind some of history's greatest writers. From the "dangerous, dirty and seductive" streets of Naples, the setting for Elena Ferrante's famous Neapolitan novels, to the "stone arches, creaky oaken doors, and riverside paths" of Oxford, the backdrop for Alice's adventures in Wonderland, <i>Footsteps</i> takes a fresh approach to literary tourism, appealing to readers and travel enthusiasts alike.</p><p>THE NEW YORK TIMES is a daily newspaper published in New York City and distributed internationally. Founded in 1851, the newspaper has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper.<br> &nbsp;<br> MONICA DRAKE is the editor of the Travel section at the <i>New York Times</i>.<b>From the Introduction, by Monica Drake</b><br><br>Back when travel was just my passion and not yet my profession, I went to the French Riviera for the party scene and in- stead found myself dazzled by the otherworldly light of day. I was marveling at how it made every waking moment dream- like when I noticed a small plaque on a building indicating that Henri Matisse had lived inside. Whatever I&#x2019;d read about Matisse and Nice before that moment hadn&#x2019;t mattered: It was then that I understood how the city had challenged him to make art as sublime as the setting.<br> All of us have experienced a moment in our travels when we stray onto turf that an artist, including those who paint pictures with words, once trod. It surprises us, this statue in the middle of a park, a street named for a luminary, or the small museum that at one point was her home. But it shouldn&#x2019;t be unexpected.<br> All the world is a reliquary, filled with fields, forests, and city plazas that lead visionaries among us to create work that endures the ages. We travelers are but devotees who touch these monuments and in place of prayers meditate on how someone else came to be who they are and create what they&nbsp;did. We inevitably look about and wonder. Did the sweep of this hill and the mist of the morning somehow ignite a spark? Was this place more incidental than inspirational? Examining these questions has been the defining task of Footsteps since 1981, when <i>The Times </i>ran it as a short-lived series. It appeared sporadically in the intervening years until it emerged as a full-fledged feature. <br>Regardless of provenance, the conceit in these pages is nearly as old as <i>The Times </i>itself. An article from 1860 chronicles a visit to Stratford-on-Avon to see the birthplace and tomb of the &#x201c;world&#x2019;s master-genius,&#x201d; William Shakespeare. That report, a faithful recounting of a voyage in the footsteps of someone universally revered, assumed the best of the Bard: &#x201c;Calm, quiet and beautiful were all the surroundings, and I thought it was not strange that one whose early childhood was passed amid such scenes as this should have partaken of their beauty, and been gentle, kind and loving.&#x201d; In aspiring to capture the interplay of a writer&#x2019;s real identity, work, and setting, this was an early version of what would become Footsteps.<br> As the breadth of the stories in this collection indicates, our approach varies as much as the literary giants that they profile. &#x201c;Mark Twain&#x2019;s Hawaii,&#x201d; for example, examines the four-month stretch in which the writer sent letters from the island, rather than tracing any of his fictional works. Yet it suffuses the place with the spirit of Twain. &#x201c;Orhan Parmuk&#x2019;s Istanbul&#x201d; is on the other end of the spectrum, using the Nobel laureate as a tour guide who leads us through the city that he has called home for nearly six decades.<br> What unifies them is a single guiding principle: Each should leave a reader with a new perspective on an artist and the place that has somehow been a muse. Often an unusual pairing is enough to supply the novelty&#x2014;as with Rimbaud in Ethiopia, a lesser-examined point in the poet&#x2019;s life. But occasionally&#x2014;as&nbsp;with Dashiell Hammett and San Francisco&#x2014;the setting and star go hand in hand until the story of the city&#x2019;s transformation is taken into account. There is little hard-boiled left in a city awash in venture capital, it turns out. As Footsteps evolves, <i>The Times </i>has been venturing farther afield to choose the settings. Inspiration comes from America and Europe and also from Chile (Borges), Martinique (Cesaire) and Vietnam (Duras). We&#x2019;ve also added contemporary personalities such as Jamaica Kincaid and Elena Ferrante to those whose trails we trace.<br> At the same time, we seek contributors who are able to view the place and the person they are profiling with equal fervor. The best of our Footsteps capture their passion for specific authors and places in time.<br> These escapes immerse travelers in a setting by providing a purpose while on the road. A fixed mission forces us to be present rather than meander about, refreshing our social feeds and lamenting the cost of international roaming. Studying the world this way pushes away workaday life that much more efficiently. These accounts can make us travelers instead of tourists.<br> And that they do, even if you do not take a trip. &#x201c;That was a pleasant journey into the real Wonderland,&#x201d; a reader wrote in response to the description of Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s Oxford. It isn&#x2019;t rare for readers to send e-mails and comments and letters that refer to a Footsteps essay as if it had been a vacation.<br> True literature itself is a flight of fancy, and appreciators of it are all too familiar with the discombobulating feeling of finishing a novel and being slightly surprised to be at home in a recliner rather than hundreds of miles&#x2014;and hundreds of years&#x2014;away. Above all, Footsteps essays are for the avid readers who can travel by simply turning a page. Turn these, and they&#x2019;ll take you around the world.</p><h2>What Is the Point of Being a Christian?</h2><p><p><b><i>What is the Point of Being a Christian?</i> has been awarded the prestigious Michael Ramsey prize for the best in theological writing. For more information please visit: www.michaelramseyprize.org.uk </b><br><b></b></p><p>What is the Point of being a Christian? One is pointed to God, who is the point of everything. If one thinks of religion as just 'useful' then one has reduced it to another consumer product. But if we are pointed to God, then this should make a difference to how we live. This is not a moral superiority. Christians are usually no better than anyone else. But the lives of Christians should be marked by some form of hope, freedom, happiness and courage. If they are not then why should anyone believe a word they say? In this new book, Timothy Radcliffe is at his best, writing with a prophetic edge. His argument for Christian belief is profoundly Catholic and profoundly human. But what is just as remarkable, Radcliffe's argument for and interpretation of Christian Gospel is couched in a deep understanding of human nature and the problems and anxieties of modern men and women. Radcliffe is far distant from the theologian's ivory tower and yet his understanding of the Gospel is profoundly theological.

Intended for those who need to improve their movement repertoire for professional reasons&#x2013;-dancers, musicians, martial artists, gymnasts, and athletes&#x2013;-as well as those wishing to reduce pain or limitations in movement, Feldenkrais is based on the idea that learning to move better can improve anyone&#x2019;s overall health on many levels.</p><p>Using Moshe Feldenkrais&#x2019;s own words, <i>Embodied Wisdom</i> clearly explains the basic principles underpinning his techniques, Awareness Through Movement (ATM) and Functional Integration (FI). These thoughtful articles and lively, sometimes humorous interviews explore a diverse range of subjects: the importance of bodily expression, the primacy of hearing, the mind-body connection, martial arts, sleep and consciousness, movement and its effect on the mind. <i>Embodied Wisdom</i> gives readers the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the scientific and spiritual principles behind the Method and offers sound strategies for incorporating it into their lives.</p></p><p>Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., (1904&#x2013;1984) was a distinguished scientist, physicist, and engineer, and the founder of the method that now bears his name.

Before long, the shogun surrendered to the emperor, a new constitution was adopted, and Japan emerged as a modern, industrialized state. <br><br>Despite the length of his reign, little has been written about the strangely obscured figure of Meiji himself, the first emperor ever to meet a European. Most historians discuss the period that takes his name while barely mentioning the man, assuming that he had no real involvement in affairs of state. Even Japanese who believe Meiji to have been their nation's greatest ruler may have trouble recalling a single personal accomplishment that might account for such a glorious reputation. Renowned Japan scholar Donald Keene sifts the available evidence to present a rich portrait not only of Meiji but also of rapid and sometimes violent change during this pivotal period in Japan's history. <br><br>In this vivid and engrossing biography, we move with the emperor through his early, traditional education; join in the formal processions that acquainted the young emperor with his country and its people; observe his behavior in court, his marriage, and his relationships with various consorts; and follow his maturation into a "Confucian" sovereign dedicated to simplicity, frugality, and hard work. Later, during Japan's wars with China and Russia, we witness Meiji's struggle to reconcile his personal commitment to peace and his nation's increasingly militarized experience of modernization. Emperor of Japan conveys in sparkling prose the complexity of the man and offers an unrivaled portrait of Japan in a period of unique interest.</p><p>This is the extraordinary story of how Japan was dramatically transformed during the long reign of Emperor Meiji, from an isolated island nation to one of the five great powers of the world, poised as a rival in Asia to Russia and the European colonial powers.Donald Keene is Shincho Professor of Japanese Literature and University Professor Emeritus at Columbia University. He is the author of more than thirty books, including the definitive multi-volume history of Japanese literature. He lives in Tokyo and New York City.</p><h2>Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now (Bible &amp; Liberation)</h2><p>Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now (Bible &amp; Liberation) [Paper...</p><p>The two authors of this volume--both committed Christians and social activists--are not interested in the idea of apocalypse as an end-of-the-world phenomenon. Rather, they conclude, St. John's book was a call to "the followers of Jesus in the cities of Roman Asia [the audience for the Revelation] to continue the nonviolent witness practiced by Jesus. This is how the disciples were to live in the midst of empire." In short, "Revelation is a call to have faith in God rather than empire." <p> Beginning with a chapter connecting the contemporary enthusiasm for apocalypse to such events as UFO sightings, near-death experiences, New Age spirituality, and even the current visions of Mary, the writers then explore the origins of apocalyptic writing in (among other places) the book of Daniel, Isaiah, and the gospels, and place John's vision in the historical context of first-century Rome. From there the book devotes itself to a close study of Revelation itself, concluding with a chapter that returns to the question of the relevance of John's vision to the current global economic empire, which is, the authors suggest, "simply the air we breathe." The deepest goal of this exciting and challenging book--like John's own Revelation--is to challenge that. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p></p><h2>Contemplating Reality: A Practitioner&#39;s Guide to the View in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism</h2><p>This book is for intermediate and advanced Buddhist practitioners who wish to deepen their understanding by joining practice with study of traditional ideas.

While an acolyte at the temple, he fixates on the structure&#x2019;s aesthetic perfection and it becomes his one and only object of desire. But as Mizoguchi begins to perceive flaws in the temple, he determines that the only true path to beauty lies in an act of horrific violence. Based on a real incident that occurred in 1950, <i>The Temple of the Golden Pavilion</i> brilliantly portrays the passions and agonies of a young man in postwar Japan, bringing to the subject the erotic imagination and instinct for the dramatic moment that marked Mishima as one of the towering makers of modern fiction.

In this reprint of a classic, originally published in 1902, he presents his findings in an accessible way. By examining the invisible bodies of humans, he shows how the colors of the aura change with different emotional states. He also points out the hidden differences between humans and animals. The result is a book which emphasizes that we are more than just the physical body; we are actually a spark of the Divine.<b>Charles Webster Leadbeater</b> (1847-1934) was a Church of England clergyman until he joined the Theosophical Society in 1883. He spent some years in Sri Lanka working for the revival of Buddhism, and later became the Presiding Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church, which seeks to combine the preservation of the Catholic sacraments with the widest measure of freedom of thought and interpretation of the scriptures. He was a highly developed clairvoyant and the author of over thirty books on the spiritual life and on the psychic nature of man. He unfolded and perfected his own psychic faculties under the guidance of his Adept teacher and in 1893 began his clairvoyant investigations, on occasion collaborating with Annie Besant, the second President of the Theosophical Society. His worldwide lectures presented a new viewpoint to thousands of people.</p><h2>Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes (Native Americans of the Northeast)</h2><p>A center of the lucrative fur trade throughout the colonial period, the Great Lakes region was an important site of cultural as well as economic exchange between native and European peoples. In this well-researched study, Susan Sleeper-Smith focuses on an often overlooked aspect of these interactions&#x2015;the role played by Indian women who married French traders.Drawing on a broad range of primary and secondary sources, she shows how these women used a variety of means to negotiate a middle ground between two disparate cultures. Many were converts to Catholicism who constructed elaborate mixed-blood kinship networks that paralleled those of native society, thus facilitating the integration of Indian and French values. By the mid-eighteenth century, native women had extended these kin linkages to fur trade communities throughout the Great Lakes, not only enhancing access to the region's highly prized pelts but also ensuring safe transport for other goods. <i>Indian Women and French Men</i> depicts the encounter of Old World and New as an extended process of indigenous adaptation and change rather than one of conflict and inevitable demise. By serving as brokers between those two worlds, Indian women who married French men helped connect the Great Lakes to a larger, expanding transatlantic economy while securing the survival of their own native culture. As such, Sleeper-Smith points out, their experiences illuminate those of other traditional cultures forced to adapt to market-motivated Europeans.</p><p>Susan Sleeper-Smith is associate professor of history at Michigan State University and coeditor of <i>New Faces of the Fur Trade: Selected Papers of the Seventh North American Fur Trade Conference.</i>"This is groundbreaking work&#x2015;a major contribution to the history of both Native Americans and women in this region. The book will become required reading for any course that focuses on the role of mixed bloods or Native Americans in the western Great Lakes and Mississippi."&#x2015;R. David Edmunds, coauthor of <i>The Fox Wars:The Mesquakie Challenge to New France</i><br><br>"This volume dramatically revises standard assumptions about fur trade society. Sleeper-Smith offers a compelling reinterpretation of native women and the fur trade that will no doubt have a major impact on how we view this aspect of American history in the future."&#x2015;Nancy Shoemaker, University of Connecticut</p><h2>Victory Conditions (Vatta&#39;s War)</h2><p>Elizabeth Moon&#x2019;s thrilling Vatta&#x2019;s War series, featuring the no-holds-barred space-faring heroine Kylara Vatta, has secured her reputation as a master of first-rate military science fiction.

It still felt a little unreal, but here they were, all waiting for her to say something: Argelos and Pettygrew, there from the beginning; Yamini, who had been Argelos&#x2019; military adviser and who now captained the stealth observer they&#x2019;d captured from the pirates; Ransome and Baskerville, the two surviving captains of Ransome&#x2019;s Rangers; Major Douglas of Mackensee Military Assistance Corporation, assigned as MMAC&#x2019;s liaison to her. His assistant, Master Sergeant Cally Pitt, seemed quite at ease standing in a corner.<br><br>&#x201c;Our main problem, as I see it, is that we&#x2019;re always reacting to Turek,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know much about him, what his goals are&#x2014;besides killing people and getting power&#x2014;and we can&#x2019;t understand any of the transmissions we&#x2019;ve overheard. We&#x2019;ve got to find a way to get better intel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mackensee might share data with you,&#x201d; Major Douglas said. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind me butting in.&#x201d; He smiled at Ky.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;Before we go into jump, would you like to ask them about that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You particularly want information about their language, any history anyone can dig up, is that right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I wouldn&#x2019;t mind knowing where they are right now, where they&#x2019;re going next, and in what force,&#x201d; Ky said, grinning.<br><br>&#x201c;If we knew that, we&#x2019;d be hauling mass,&#x201d; Douglas said. &#x201c;All of us. But I can ask if any of our linguists know the language. You gave them copies of the transmissions, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did, yes,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;And another thing . . . I know I need a staff structure. We talked about that before, but with over forty ships to command, I need something now, before we get to Cascadia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Think any of those privateers will give you trouble?&#x201d; Argelos asked. Ky was mildly amused to find that the former privateer no longer considered himself one of them.<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt it,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;Aunt Grace sent them; she&#x2019;d have checked them out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t just need a staff,&#x201d; Douglas said. &#x201c;You need a combat control center. You can&#x2019;t command forty ships from the bridge on this one&#x2014;it&#x2019;s too crowded, and it doesn&#x2019;t have the right communications setup. Your shipboard ansibles are an incredible advance, but they can&#x2019;t do everything and they are bulky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My office&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t adequate,&#x201d; Captain Yamini said. &#x201c;I agree with Major Douglas. Running the additional communications cables in here would be next to impossible, and they must be shielded cables. You&#x2019;re talking over forty ships now, and maybe more if the Moscoe Confederation sends ships from Cascadia. That&#x2019;s a lot of equipment, not just for communications but also for scan, if you&#x2019;re to have the data you need during a battle. I don&#x2019;t know how you&#x2019;d get one in this ship&#x2014;you&#x2019;d have to practically rebuild it, I&#x2019;d think&#x2014;but then you&#x2019;ve told us it needs serious work anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On our ships, the CCC is built in when the hulls are laid,&#x201d; Douglas put in. &#x201c;But I understand that some systems have modular CCCs that can be retrofitted to vessels. We don&#x2019;t, but maybe they can do that at Cascadia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Before we go FTL, we should ask Stella that,&#x201d; Ky said, adding another line to the list in her implant. A long list, now, since she had heard about the Slotter Key privateers on their way to Cascadia, turned down Mackensee&#x2019;s offer of a commission, and accepted the suggestion of a liaison to travel with her. In a few short hours, her little group would leave the Mackensee&#x2019;s headquarters world and head for Cascadia Station . . . and she would have to be ready, when they arrived, to take charge in reality as the commander she had hoped to become.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have two jump transitions on the way,&#x201d; Argelos said. &#x201c;Do you want communication there, or not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re both just waypoints, aren&#x2019;t they? Uninhabited systems?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. But the ansibles are up in both right now. We might find out what&#x2019;s going on&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good idea,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to delay more than we have to, but stripping bulletins from ansibles doesn&#x2019;t take long. Everyone should do it, so you can each run your own analysis and we can share. Intership communication only by onboard ansibles, no matter how close we are.&#x201d;<br><br>Her deskcom chimed; Hugh Pritang&#x2019;s code. &#x201c;Yes, Hugh?&#x201d; Ky said.<br><br>&#x201c;Last load&#x2019;s coming aboard here, Captain. Last for Sharra&#x2019;s Gift is a half hour out. Bassoon&#x2019;s complete. Mackensee&#x2019;s Traffic Control officer has given us a priority departure slot in two point five hours. Next after that&#x2019;s at three point five. Thought you&#x2019;d want to know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, Hugh,&#x201d; Ky said. To the others, she said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better get with it, hadn&#x2019;t we? I&#x2019;d like to take that early slot, so this meeting will have to be short.&#x201d;<br><br>For another hour, they hammered out the organization of skeleton staff, to be filled out once they arrived at Cascadia, then dispersed to their various ships. Ky made the calls courtesy required to the Mackensee officers who had assisted them, sent databurst messages to Stella, Grace, and Rafe, and then went to the bridge as they undocked and headed out toward the jump point.<br><br>Nexus II, Headquarters of InterStellar Communications<br><br>Rafe Dunbarger, acting CEO of InterStellar Communications, looked at the monitor in the central control room of ISC&#x2019;s detention center. The man in the security cell looked older than his official years and very tired. All the gloss of wealth and power had leached away, leaving his face exposed, the dissatisfaction and ambition clear to see.<br><br>&#x201c;You sure you&#x2019;ve got everything?&#x201d; Rafe asked his new internal security chief.<br><br>&#x201c;As sure as we can be. His implant was coded to self-destruct if removed, of course, but we were able to block that and examine it. Downloaded everything we could. And before we took his implant, we&#x2019;d done a full panel, &#x2019;cept what you&#x2019;d told us not to.&#x201d; Faint regret colored his tone.<br><br>&#x201c;I have my reasons,&#x201d; Rafe said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure, Ser Dunbarger. Not arguing, just saying.&#x201d;<br><br>Rafe watched the man on the monitor shift his weight on the narrow bed. Now came the question, the final question at the end of all the data collection. What to do with the man who had destroyed his childhood and much of his adulthood, who had separated him from his father, who had schemed and plotted and finally attacked his own mentor, Rafe&#x2019;s father? Who had contrived the killing of Rafe&#x2019;s sisters, the death of his surviving sister&#x2019;s husband and child? He surely deserved death, but . . . what death could encompass his crimes? And what about legal procedures?<br><br>He&#x2019;d made discreet inquiries, and the answer came back that it was ISC&#x2019;s problem. The government didn&#x2019;t want a noisy, embarrassing, expensive trial any more than he did. They wanted the problem removed.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a hundred percent liability,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d been told. But he&#x2019;d been told that about himself, when it wasn&#x2019;t true. Was it ever true? The man had intelligence, talents, charisma . . . he had earned the trust of the Board, of Rafe&#x2019;s father . . . could he have been, in some way, as misunderstood, or at least as complex, as Rafe?<br><br>&#x201c;Would&#x2019;ve been easier to kill him that first day,&#x201d; Gary said.<br><br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Rafe sighed. No matter what he did, leaving Lewis Parmina alive would be too dangerous. The man was a threat, not only to him and his family but also to ISC, Nexus, and the new alliance. In the heat of his early rage, he could have enjoyed killing the man himself . . . but now his stomach churned at the thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You going to tell him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He expects it,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not stupid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They always hope,&#x201d; Gary said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll speak to him,&#x201d; Rafe said. He wasn&#x2019;t sure why he felt that he must, but he knew if he didn&#x2019;t he would regret it forever.<br><br>&#x201c;Not without a guard,&#x201d; Gary said.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stupid, either.&#x201d; Gary grunted, and Rafe grinned at him. &#x201c;And not you&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll take whoever&#x2019;s on duty in the section.&#x201d;<br><br>It was only a short walk to the guard station at the entrance to the block of cells. He let the guard open the cell, and then followed him in. The guard stepped to one side, stun-rod ready.<br><br>&#x201c;Enjoying yourself, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Lew Parmina said. His gaze flicked to the guard and back to Rafe&#x2019;s face. His smile widened. &#x201c;Still the scared little boy, are we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cautious,&#x201d; Rafe said, keeping the edge out of his voice. Mild interest, no more. &#x201c;You might take it as a sign of respect.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not from me,&#x201d; Lew said. He put his hands behind his head; the guard shifted slightly, watchful. &#x201c;Having fun with the company? I left you a few surprises . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As much as possible,&#x201d; Rafe said.<br><br>&#x201c;My family?&#x201d; Judging by the sneer on his face, he didn&#x2019;t really care about them.<br><br>&#x201c;Are fine,&#x201d; Rafe said. He waited a predictable two beats.<br><br>&#x201c;No conjugal visit before the end?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She refused,&#x201d; Rafe said. Parmina&#x2019;s wife had done more than refuse; she had gone into hysterics at the mention of that possibility.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah. Well, then, I presume this is the obligatory so long, farewell, see-you-in-hell session? Or are you going to go all mushy and ask why I betrayed your father&#x2019;s trust?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no interest in why you did it,&#x201d; Rafe said.<br><br>Lew shrugged. &#x201c;Well, then. Get it over with. Unless you&#x2019;re planning to drag it out with torture or something. I know you&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t pretend you don&#x2019;t enjoy killing.&#x201d;<br><br>Rafe smiled down at him, holding Parmina&#x2019;s gaze until the man had to look down. &#x201c;I ration myself,&#x201d; he said then. He nodded to the guard, who opened the door and turned to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;You coward!&#x201d; Lew screamed, and lurched forward. Even as Rafe spun, drawing his own weapon, the guard&#x2019;s stunner struck Lew; he collapsed, clawing at his neck.<br><br>&#x201c;Go on, ser; I&#x2019;ll take care of this,&#x201d; the guard said.<br><br>&#x201c;Quickly,&#x201d; Rafe said. He holstered his pistol. &#x201c;No playtime.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; the guard said.<br><br>Rafe waited in the corridor outside. After a moment the guard emerged.<br><br>&#x201c;Autopsy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;The family has requested no autopsy and no funeral. I&#x2019;d say dispose of the body to medical research, except that he might have hidden something else nasty internally. If you can remove the implant in a secure facility, do that. Direct cremation&#x2019;s safest. Be sure to fill out the paperwork.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in his office, Rafe made the necessary calls. Lew&#x2019;s wife cried, more with relief than sorrow, but he still felt compelled to comfort her. The daughter Lew had abused listened stony-faced, and said only &#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Rafe&#x2019;s sister Penny nodded once, then burst into tears&#x2014;clearly relief, this time&#x2014;and his mother, on the com, did the same. Official reaction was subdued but clearly glad that ISC had handled ISC&#x2019;s problem.<br><br>He felt none of the exultation he had felt before . . . only a peculiar sense of loss that he finally identified as grief. Lew Parmina was dead, and deservedly so, but he had been as human as Rafe himself. He thought suddenly of Ky, and her moment of compassion for the spy they had caught on her ship . . . she would have understood this. How could someone have gone so wrong?<br><br>He informed the Board that afternoon, at their regular meeting. &#x201c;Lew Parmina is dead,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He tried to attack me, in the cell; a guard killed him. The death was reported to all the proper authorities; the family declined to receive the remains or hold a funeral; they asked that ISC dispose of them. He was cremated immediately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About time,&#x201d; Vaclav Box said. He had urged the need for Parmina&#x2019;s death more than once. &#x201c;Poisonous creature.&#x201d; Others murmured agreement. No one wanted to be seen as defending Parmina.<br><br>&#x201c;Next,&#x201d; Rafe said, &#x201c;the latest medical report on my father.&#x201d; At first they had demanded such reports almost daily, but lately he had noticed more time between questions, and less apparent interest. &#x201c;His speech has improved, though slowly. His doctors, however, hold out no hope that he will be able to take up his duties as CEO even part-time within the next four months . . . and they do not think he will ever be able to use an internal implant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not even on the other side?&#x201d; Vaclav Box asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Apparently not,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;Because of the existing damage, they&#x2019;re concerned that any manipulation to create the pocket could cause seizures&#x2014;or worse. An external device might be possible, but . . . he had had a right-sided implant his whole life.&#x201d; He looked down for a moment, imagining what it must be like without an implant, without that reassuring presence. &#x201c;We had all hoped, of course, that the neural regeneration would proceed more swiftly.&#x201d; Then he could have gotten back to his own life, though he had no idea what that life might be.<br><br>Glances passed back and forth across the table; for a long moment no one said anything.<br><br>Finally, Box cleared his throat. &#x201c;About your father . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;ve talked to him. So have some of the others. I&#x2019;m certainly aware he&#x2019;s not what he was. And&#x2014;for the most part&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t want him back.&#x201d; Box paused a moment, clearly trying to gauge Rafe&#x2019;s reaction. Rafe felt as if a load of rock had dropped on his head; he couldn&#x2019;t think of anything to say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m one of his oldest friends; I still consider him a friend. But he got us into this whole mess; his judgment was faulty long before his injury. Or perhaps it had been tampered with, but that doesn&#x2019;t really matter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve canvassed the Board?&#x201d; Rafe found his voice at last, looking around at them all.<br><br>&#x201c;Informally, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t blame everything on him. It was Lew&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was fooled by Parmina, to the point of repudiating his own son.&#x201d; Box went on, enumerating the same things Rafe had struggled not to see. &#x201c;The policies he approved led directly to the mess we&#x2019;re in now&#x2014;the erosion of our ability to protect our monopoly, the failure to gain control of new technology, the theft of our intellectual property . . . Parmina may have been the mastermind, but your father did not see the dangers.&#x201d;<br><br>Neither had the Board, Rafe thought. They had all been fooled just as much as his father. Had they ever done anything more than nod yes and take their compensation? &#x201c;Then . . . if you don&#x2019;t want my father, you won&#x2019;t want me,&#x201d; he said. He felt letdown and relief at the same moment.<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all, Rafe. You did see the problems; you&#x2019;ve clarified them for all of us; you&#x2019;ve started turning the corporation around. We need you and we want you. Now and for the foreseeable future. I don&#x2019;t believe&#x2014;and I am sure the Board concurs&#x2014;that there is anyone else who could possibly save as much of what we had.&#x201d;<br><br>The others nodded. The weight fell back on his shoulders. He wanted to yell at them, insist he was not the one for the job, but he knew . . . he knew he was.<br><br>&#x201c;The only problem,&#x201d; Box said slowly, &#x201c;is this thing with the Vatta family and your relationship with them. On this I stand with your father, and I think I speak for most of the Board. There are reasons to be concerned; they are involved in too many of the things that have gone wrong, that have cost us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t seriously believe . . .&#x201d; Rafe stopped, faced with that double row of stony faces. They did believe it. He would have to change that&#x2014;they would have to understand that their future lay with a Vatta alliance.</p><h2>Baskets: Projects, techniques and inspirational designs for you and your home</h2><p>Baskets are a simple but stylish way to organize your home.

African American Studies. LGBT Studies. Using traditional storytelling and nontraditional verse to chronicle the course of love returning in the lifetimes of one woman-loving-woman named bull-dog-jean, the bull-jeanstories give cultural documentation and social commentary on African-American herstory and survival. Set in the rural South of the 1920s, THE BULL-JEAN STORIES herald the spirit of African-American people. <br> <br> "BULL-JEAN STORIES by Sharon Bridgforth isn't a book that you read, it's a book that you hear...The language in THE BULL-JEAN STORIES is sweet and intense, as are the thoughts and exploits of bull-dog-jean. Every passage sings...This book gets my unqualified recommendation and also a suggestion: if you can get Austin performance artist Bridgforth to your town for a reading, do it. You won't be disappointed."&#x2014;Sara Look <br> <br> "The book [THE BULL-JEAN STORIES] brings to life the sights and sounds of the rural south in the 1920s with stories that leap to you from the well of love and life, untangling open heart wounds with words and uncovering the strength of the author in pure character. ..Bridgforth's talent as a storyteller is purposeful and loving. Consistent in THE BULL-JEAN STORIES is the cultural shadow that bull-jean, an 'all-my-heart' revolutionary, secretly and outwardly conquers with nobility and ease, but not without pain...The book carries you with it, not the other way around."&#x2014;Sandra Beckmeier <br> <br> "...Set in the rural South of the 1920s, these stories are infused with a mother tongue that will work its magic on you, transporting you in time and place...The non-linear structure of her poetic/circular storytelling in the bull- jean stories makes for a natural transition from page to stage. It also is a very ingenious way to highlight what is the essence of oral tradition: how it sounds...Here the rhythm and the flow of the words and the dialect come together as if in song. These jazzy poetic riffs need to be read aloud.

It includes routines and writings from such luminaries as Bert Williams, Butterbeans &amp; Susie, Stepin Fetchit, Moms Mabley, Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, Redd Foxx, Ishmael Reed, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Martin Lawrence, and Chris Rock. This anthology includes classic stage routines, literary examples, and witty quotations presented in their entirety.<br></p><p><b>Mel Watkins</b> is a former editor&nbsp;for the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> and the author of <i>On the Real Side</i> and <i>Dancing with Strangers</i>. He lives in New York City.<br>Comedy of and by blacks often reflects a strong counterpoint to comedy about blacks in mainstream white America. During slavery and Reconstruction, blacks embraced the minstrel show format, a caricature of blacks via whites in blackface, to find their reflections even in the debilitating genre. That desire continued in film with Stepin Fetchit, Willie Best, and the Amos and Andy series. However, Watkins draws from a deeper well and includes literary sources of jokes, rhymes, poems, and stand-up comic routines that reflect nearly two centuries of black American humor. Chris Rock, Flip Wilson, and Martin Lawrence are included as examples of contemporary humorists. Watkins also includes such pioneer comedians as Bert Williams, who often performed in blackface; Moms Mabley; and Redd Foxx. He also provides excellent examples of black humor and social commentary through excerpts of literary work, including Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, Ishmael Reed, and others. This comedic focus provides a prism view and critique of America usually shielded from mainstream exposure.

A nameless woman speaks, at first from the precarious perch of a therapist&#x2019;s couch, and her smart, wry, confiding, immensely sympathetic voice immediately captures and holds our attention. She is the mother of a vast, swelling brood of children, also nameless, and the wife of a successful screenwriter, Jake Armitage. The Armitages live in the city, but they are building a great glass tower in the country in which to settle down and live happily ever after. But could that dream be nothing more than a sentimental delusion? At the edges of vision the spectral children come and go, while our heroine, alert to the countless gradations of depression and the innumerable forms of betrayal, tries to make sense of it all: doctors, husbands, movie stars, bodies, grocery lists, nursery rhymes, messes, aging parents, memories, dreams, and breakdowns.

The family moved often, and Penelope was educated at half a dozen institutions before spending a year at the University of London. In 1937 she married the journalist Charles Dimont, with whom she had two daughters. Two more daughters by two different men would follow before, in 1949, she divorced Dimont and married the barrister, novelist, and playwright John Mortimer, with whom she had another daughter and her only son. The Mortimers were celebrated as &#x201c;the last word in marital chic,&#x201d; but the marriage was tumultuous and the couple divorced in 1972. In addition to <i>The Pumpkin Eater </i>(1962), made&nbsp;into a 1964 film from a screenplay by Harold Pinter and starring&nbsp;Anne Bancroft and Peter Finch, Mortimer published several other&nbsp;novels, including <i>Daddy&#x2019;s Gone A-Hunting</i> (1958),<i> Long Distance</i>&nbsp;(1974), and <i>The Handyman </i>(1983); a travel book co-authored with&nbsp;John Mortimer, <i>With Love and Lizards</i> (1957); and a biography of&nbsp;the Queen Mother. She also served as a film critic for the <i>London&nbsp;Observer</i> and was a regular contributor of short stories to <i>The New&nbsp;Yorker.</i> The first volume of her autobiography <i>About Time</i> (1979)&nbsp;was awarded the Whitbread Prize and was followed by <i>About Time&nbsp;Too</i> (1993).<br><br> Daphne Merkin is the author of <i>Enchantment</i>, a novel and&nbsp;<i>Dreaming of Hitler,</i> a collection of essays.

Reclaiming the Hidden Self or Repressed Center completes, heals, and integrates our personality. Through real-life examples and questions for personal or group use, the authors detail this soul-making process by which we become rounded, capable of love, and empowered to create and contribute.</p><p>Hurley and Dobson explor the three centers of human intelligence -- the Intellectual, the Relational, and the Creative -- and how they operate in our lives. Each of the nine personality types <em>prefers</em> one center, relies on another for backup support, and <em>represses</em> one center altogether. The Enneagram challenge is to recover the lost resources of our personality's repressed center. Freed to be fully intellectual, creative, and relational in our living, we become able to achieve harmony, joy, love, and creativity.</p></p><p>Kathleen V. Hurley and Theodore E. Dobson, the authors of <em>What's My Type?,</em> are counselors and Enneagram workshop leaders. They live in Lakewood, Colorado.The authors, psychologists and Enneagram workshop leaders, present basic Enneagram background quickly and then go on to focus on new material: the idea that each Enneagram type has a "repressed center" caused by an "original wound" and that types three, six, and nine have two subtypes with different repressed centers. Hurley and Dobson believe that soul-making has been neglected; hence, exercises, for group or individual use, are included to foster the soul-making process and help individuals become loving and creative persons.

Visit her at GenaShowalter.com.<br><br><em>Let's get the party started, </em>Gideon thought with unparalleled determination as he stomped through the renovated hallways of his Budapest fortress.<br><br>The demon of Lies hummed inside his head, heartily in agreement. Both of them liked Scarlet, their alleged wife, but for different reasons. Gideon liked the look of her and the saucy, forked-tongued comments she made. Lies liked... Gideon wasn't sure. He only knew that the beast purred in approval every time she opened her beautiful, I-can-do-things-you've-only-dreamed-about mouth.<br><br>It was a reaction usually reserved for pathological liars. Except, the demon couldn't actually tell if she fibbed or not. Which meant beneath all that affection for Scarlet, Lies was frustrated, sensitive to every word that left Gideon's mouth. And that made <em>Gideon's </em>life frustrating as hell. He couldn't even call his friends by their own names anymore.<br><br>Was she or wasn't she a filthy freaking liar? And yeah, he was well aware of the irony. He, a man who couldn't utter a single truth, was complaining about someone who might be feeding him a big, heaping bowl of shit. But were they or weren't they? Had they or hadn't they? He had to know before he drove himself insane, puzzling over everything she'd ever said and everything he'd ever done and thought.<br><br>His request that she just lay out the facts, black and white, boom, done, <em>over </em>had been ignored for the last time.<br><br>He was finally taking action.<br><br>Hopefully, pretending to rescue her from his own dungeon would cause her to trust him. Hopefully, trusting him would cause her to open the hell up and answer his godsdamn questions.<br><br>Oops. His frustration was showing again.<br><br>"You can't do this, Gid," Strider, keeper of the demon of Defeat, said, suddenly keeping pace beside him.<br><br>Fuck. Anyone but him.<br><br>Strider couldn't lose a challenge, <em>any </em>challenge, without suffering as Gideon suffered when he spoke true. Including Xbox, and that was seriously screwing with Gideon's "Assassin's Creed" mojo, because yeah, Gideon had challenged him, trying to distract himself and work out the stiffness in his new fingers.<br><br><em>Anyway</em>. Always, without question, he and Strider guarded each other's backs (video games aside). So, he shouldn't have been surprised that his friend was here, resolved to save him from himself. Didn't mean he'd roll over and play dead.<br><br>"She's dangerous," Strider added. "A walking blade through the heart, dude."<br><br>Yes, she was. She invaded dreams, presented sleepers with their worst fears and fed off the ensuing terror. Hell, a few weeks ago, she'd done it to him. With spiders. He shuddered, momentarily sick to his stomach as he pictured the hairy little bastards crawling all over him.<br><br><em>Pussy. Suck it up</em>. He'd faced countless swinging swords without flinching&#x2014;as well as the monsters wielding them. What were a few spiders? Another shudder. Revolting, that's what. He knew what they were thinking every time their beady eyes landed on him: <em>tasty</em>.<br><br>But why hadn't Scarlet invaded anyone else's dreams? He'd wondered about that almost as much as he'd wondered about their "marriage." The other warriors, their female companions, she'd left alone. Despite the fact that she'd threatened to slaughter every single one of them. Something she truly could do.<br><br>"Damn it. Stop ignoring me," Strider growled, punching a hole in the silver-stone wall seconds after they passed a closed bedroom door. "You know my demon doesn't like it."<br><br>Dust and debris plumed the air, a loud crack echoing. Great. Soon, other warriors would be up and running to find out what had just happened. Or maybe not. As temperamental as members of this household were (<em>cough </em>too much testosterone <em>cough</em>), they had to be used to unexpected, violent noises.<br><br>"Look. I'm not sorry." Gideon flicked his friend a glance, taking in the blond hair, the blue eyes and the deceptively innocent features that were somehow perfect for his he-man build. More than one woman had called him "beautifully all-American," whatever that meant. Those same women usually avoided looking at Gideon, as if even roving their gazes over his tattoos and piercings would blacken their souls. For all he knew, they were right. "But you're correct. I can't do this."<br><br>Which meant that Strider was wrong and, yes, Gideon damn well could do this. <em>So suck it!</em><br><br>Everyone who lived in this fortress&#x2014;and godsdamn, there were a lot of people, the number seemingly growing by the day as his friends each hooked up with their "one and only" (gag)&#x2014;was fluent in Gideon Speak and knew to believe the opposite of whatever he said.<br><br>"Fine," Strider said tightly. "You can. But you won't. Because you know that if you take the woman out of this home, I'll go gray from worry. And you like my hair the way it is."<br><br>"Stridey-man. Are you hitting on me? Trying to get me to run my fingers through those mangy locks?"<br><br>"Shithead," Strider muttered, but his anger was clearly defused.<br><br>Gideon chuckled. "Sweetie pie."<br><br>Strider's lips even twitched into a grin. "You know I hate when you get mushy like that."<br><br>Boy loved it. No question.<br><br>They snaked a corner, bypassing one of the many sitting rooms the fortress possessed. This one was empty. As early in the morning as it was, most of the warriors were still in bed with their women. If they weren't weaponing-up at that exact moment, of course.<br><br>Out of habit, he scanned the area. In this particular room, portraits of naked men littered the walls, courtesy of the goddess of Anarchy whose warped sense of humor rivaled Gideon's own. There were red leather chairs (Reyes, the keeper of Pain, sometimes had to cut himself to quiet his demon, so red came in handy), gleaming bookshelves (Paris, keeper of Promiscuity, enjoyed romance novels), and weird silver lamps that twisted and curved over the chairs; he had no idea who those were for. Fresh flowers bloomed from vases, sweetly scenting the air. Again, he had no idea. Fine. He'd requested those. That shit smelled <em>good</em>.<br><br>Gideon breathed deeply of that fresh, delicious air. Except he ended up inhaling a nose full of guilt. Sadly, that happened all the time lately. While he luxuriated in <em>this</em>, his would-be wife rotted below in the dungeons. Before this, she'd spent thousands of years in Tartarus, so that made him doubly cruel for leaving her down there.<br><br>Really, what kind of man allowed such a thing? An asshole, that's who, and he was certainly king of them. After all, he was going to return Scarlet to the dungeon once his questions were answered. For, like, ever. Even if she was&#x2014;or rather, <em>had been</em>&#x2014;his wife.<br><br>Yes. He was a bad, bad man.<br><br>She was simply too dangerous to be permanently freed, her ability to invade dreams too destructive. Because when you died in one of Scarlet's nightmares, you died for real. That was it. The end. And if she ever decided to aid the Hunters, which could happen, scorned women and all that, the Lords would never be able to sleep soundly again. And they needed their beauty rest or they became snarling beasts.<br><br>Case in point: Gideon. He hadn't slept in weeks.<br><br><em>Slow down, </em>his demon suddenly instructed. <em>Moving too fast</em>.<br><br>Usually Lies was merely a presence in the back of his mind. There, but silent. Only when the demon's need was great did he speak up. But even then, he had to say the opposite of what he wanted. And now he wanted Gideon to hurry up and reach Scarlet.<br><br><em>Give me wings and it's done, </em>Gideon replied dryly, but damn if he didn't quicken his step. He could and did think what he meant. Always. He never lied to himself or the demon during these private moments. Maybe because he'd had to fight savagely and without mercy for such moments.<br><br>Upon possession, he'd been lost to darkness and chaos, a slave to his soul-companion and his evil cravings. He'd tormented humans just to hear them scream. He'd burned homes to the ground, as well as the families inside them. He'd killed indiscriminately, and taunted while doing so.<br><br>It had taken a few hundred years, but Gideon had finally clawed his way to the light. <em>He </em>was in control now, and had even managed to tame the beast. For the most part.<br><br>Strider heaved a sigh, regaining his attention. "Gideon, man, listen to me. I said it once, but I'll say it again. You can't take the female outside these walls. She'll run from you, you know she will. Hunters are in the city, we know that, too, and they could catch her. Recruit her. Use her. Or, if she refuses them, even hurt her like they hurt you."<br><br>One, Strider was speaking as if Gideon couldn't hold on to the wily temptress for a few days. And he could. He knew how to kick ass and take names with the best. Two, Strider was speaking as if Gideon would be unable to find her if he did indeed lose her. And three, Strider was probably speaking correctly, but that didn't soothe Gideon's sudden burst of anger. He may not be the smooth operator that Strider was, but he had <em>some </em>skills with the ladies, damn it.<br><br>More than that, Scarlet herself was a warrior. An immortal. She could surround herself with darkness. A darkness so thick no human light, and no immortal eyes, could penetrate it. Losing her wouldn't be as disgraceful as losing, say, an untrained human.<br><br>Not that he'd lose her, he told himself again, and not that she would <em>want </em>to run. He was going to seduce her. Was going to pleasure the energy right out of her and make her desperate to stay with him. Which shouldn't be too difficult. She'd liked him enough to marry him, right? Maybe.<br><br>Damn it!<br><br>"I know what you're thinking," Strider said after another sigh. "If she escapes you, so what? You'll find her."<br><br>"Wrong." He had thought that, yeah, but he'd soon discarded the idea. So there. <em>What are you? A girl?</em><br><br>"Well, what happens to her while you're looking for her? During the day she needs protection, and if you're not with her, who's going to protect her?"<br><br>Fuck. Good point. Scarlet couldn't function during daylight hours. Because of her demon, she slept too deeply. So deeply that nothing and no one could wake her until sunset, a fact he'd discovered after nearly giving her a brain aneurysm while trying and failing to shake her into consciousness.<br><br>He had been shocked when, a few hours later, her eyes had popped open and she'd sat up as if she'd just taken a ten-minute power nap.<br><br>Which had raised other questions. Why did her demon sleep during the day, when the people around her were awake? Didn't that defeat the purpose of creating nightmares? And what happened when she traveled and the time zone changed?<br><br>"We're lucky we found her when we did," Strider continued. "If we hadn't had Aeron's angel on our side, we would've died trying to secure her. Setting her free, no matter the reason, is stupid and danger&#x2014;"<br><br>"You haven't said that before." Over and over again. "Besides, Olive's no longer on our team." Meaning, she was. "She can't help us again if needed." Meaning she could. "Now, I hate you, man, but please keep talking." <em>I love you, but shut the hell up! </em>Seriously.<br><br>Strider growled his renewed frustration as they pounded down the steps that led into the dungeon, stained-glass windows giving way to crumbling, bloodstained walls. The air became musty, tainted with sweat, urine and blood. None of it was Scarlet's, thank the gods. His guilt couldn't have handled that. Fortunately&#x2014;or unfortunately, depending on whom you asked&#x2014;she wasn't the only being locked away. They had several Hunters awaiting payback, aka interrogation, aka torture.<br><br>"What if she was lying to you?" his friend asked. The man didn't know when to quit, and yeah, Gideon knew Strider <em>couldn't </em>quit. Which was why he didn't simply punch his friend in the face and beat feet. "What if she's not really your wife?"<br><br>Gideon snorted. "Forgot to tell you. Sifting through truth and lies is difficult for me." Except with her, but he wasn't going to issue that reminder just then.<br><br>"Yeah, but you also told me you don't know with her."<br><br>One of them had a perfect memory. Excellent. "There's no way she can be my wife." The chances were slim, but yeah, they were there. "I don't have to do this."<br><br>When Scarlet had first invaded his dreams and demanded he visit her in this dungeon, he'd been helpless to do otherwise, filled with a need to see her, some part of him recognizing her on a level he still didn't understand. When she'd alleged they'd kissed, had sex, even wed each other, that same part of him had hummed in agreement.<br><br>Even though he didn't fucking remember her.<br><br><em>Why </em>couldn't he remember her? he wondered for the thousandth time.<br><br>He'd been playing with several theories. The first: the gods had erased his memory. But that raised the question of why. Why would they not want him to recall his own wife? Why had they not erased Scarlet's memory, as well?<br><br>The second theory: he'd suppressed the memory himself. But again, why would he have done so? <em>How </em>would he have done so? There were a million other things he'd actually <em>like </em>to forget.<br><br>The third: his demon had somehow erased the memory when they were paired. But if that were true, why did he recall his life in the heavens, when he'd been a servant to Zeus, tasked with guarding the former god king at every moment of every day?<br><br>He and Strider stopped at the first cell, where Scarlet had resided the past few weeks. She was asleep on her cot, as he'd known she would be. And as he'd done each time he'd seen her, he sucked in a breath. <em>Lovely</em>. But...<br><br><em>Mine? </em>Did he want her to be?<br><br>No, of course not. That would complicate the hell out of everything. Not that he'd let it matter. He couldn't. His friends came first. That's the way things were, and the way they would always be.<br><br>At least she was clean; he'd made sure she had enough water to drink and to bathe. And she was well fed; he'd made sure food was delivered three times a night. He would do the same when he ultimately returned her. That would have to be enough.<br><br><em>Don't hurry, </em>Lies cried, practically jumping from one corner of his skull to the other. <em>Don't hurry!</em><br><br><em>Cram it, buddy. I'll handle this</em>. But he couldn't force himself to move just yet. He'd been waiting for this moment forever, it seemed, and wanted to bask in it.<br><br>Bask? He really was becoming a woman.<br><br><em>Look away before you get an erection, </em>he told himself. All right, now that was more manly. He purposefully shifted his gaze. The walls around her were composed of thick, impenetrable stone. Therefore, she could never see the Hunters imprisoned beside her. Actually, Gideon didn't care about that. He didn't want the Hunters seeing <em>her</em>.<br><br>Yeah. He wanted <em>mine. </em>At least for now.<br><br></p><h2>A Long Way Down: A Literary Thriller (Ryan DeMarco Mystery, 3)</h2><p><p>"Silvis is at it again, striving for a blend of crime story and literature, mutilated bodies and lapidary prose."&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p><p><strong>Just when you think you've reached the bottom...</strong></p><p>Ryan DeMarco would rather not go home.

In 1968, after years of playing dive bars and lesbian cabarets on the Greenwich Village scene, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Bob Dylan and Lenny Bruce, the forty-something falsetto-voiced, ukulele-playing Tiny Tim landed a recording contract with Sinatra's Reprise label and an appearance on NBC's Laugh-In. The resulting album, God Bless Tiny Tim, and its single, 'Tip-toe Thru' The Tulips With Me', catapulted him to the highest levels of fame. Soon, Tiny was playing to huge audiences in the USA and Europe, while his marriage to the seventeen-year-old 'Miss' Vicki was broadcast on The Tonight Show in front of an audience of fifty million. Before long, however, his star began to fade. Miss Vicki left him, his earnings evaporated, and the mainstream turned its back on him. He would spend the rest of his life trying to revive his career, with many of those attempts taking a turn toward the absurd. But while he is often characterized as an oddball curio, Tiny Tim was a master interpreter and student of early American popular song, and his story is one of Shakespearean tragedy framed around a bizarre yet loveable public persona. Here, drawing on dozens of new interviews, never-before-seen diaries, and years of original research, author Justin Martell brings that story to life with the first serious biography of one of the most fascinating yet misunderstood figures in popular music.</p></p><p><p><b> Justin Martell</b> is an independent filmmaker and writer. Considered 'one of America's foremost experts' on Tiny Tim, he has consulted on and contributed liner notes to two posthumous Tiny Tim releases, I've Never Seen A Straight Banana (Collector's Choice, 2009) and Lost &amp; Found: Volume 1 (Secret Seven Records, 2011). In 2013, he put out a previously unreleased Tiny Tim track on a limited-edition Edison wax cylinder, which Time.com dubbed the 'most retro record release ever'.</p><p></p><p><b>Alanna Wray McDonald</b> is a poet, writer, and freelance art director for film and television.

She's Anna Wintour, editor in chief of <i>Vogue</i>, the world's fashion bible. With her signature Louise Brooks bob, trademark sunglasses, and glamorous furs, she's a sexy international diva, gossiped about the world over. As famed designed Oscar de la Renta declares, "She's a star."</p><p>How did Wintour, who quit school over the length of her hemline, and who had no real writing or communication skills, rise to the pinnacle of the fashion magazine world? Based on scores of interviews with present and former friends and colleagues, <i>Front Row</i> is the scrupulously researched, often shocking life story of this enigmatic icon&#x2015;a candid portrait of a fashion-obsessed teenager in Swinging Sixties London who claws her way up the ivory tower in New York. It is also an intimate examination of Wintour's personal passions and needs, her loves lost and won, and her feuds and achievements. Anna Wintour's story is an inside look at one of the world's most influential women as well as the catty, competitive bitch-eat-bitch world of fashion. <i>Meow!</i></p></p><p><p>Jerry Oppenheimer has been writing definitive, bestselling biographies of American icons since the mideighties. His subjects have included Martha Stewart, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ethel Kennedy, Barbara Walters, Jerry Seinfeld, and Rock Hudson. He has worked in all facets of journalism, from national investigative reporting in Washington, D.C., to producing TV news and documentaries.</p>The editor in chief of a pop-culture magazine where I used to work would sternly forbid the staff to use the word "icon," unless they were referring to ancient Russian religious art. And I applauded him! The English language is eroding fast, and we need to throw up all possible embankments.<p>Yet when one reads Jerry Oppenheimer's gleefully ballyhooed biography of another editor in chief -- or "editrix," a sexist term Anna Wintour helped inspire -- icon is exactly the word that comes to mind. Not in the sense of "legend" or "very big celebrity," as it is breathlessly applied to people like Madonna (though in the fashion industry at least, Wintour has certainly achieved such stature), but "icon" meaning image, portrait, cartoon. Many ex-friends, lovers and business associates sallied forth to speak about Wintour -- now 55, a woman in her prime like Miss Jean Brodie, presiding over the cr�me de la cr�me or rather the skim milk of skim milk of the Cond� Nast finishing school. (Disclosure: I am a contributing editor at Allure, a Cond� Nast publication.) But most of her current intimates refused to speak for the record, and in the absence of such testimony, the author often is forced to construct his aloof, elusive subject as a collection of visual symbols. Wintour is her miniskirt; her bobbed hair (it gets a five-page disquisition); her bloody-rare hamburger; her ubiquitous sunglasses -- which, we learn in one of the book's few sympathetic moments, are not a style affectation, but a cover up; the poor thing is apparently "blind as a bat." Could it be that Vogue's top vixen has some personality traits in common with another "icon" of this season, the half-deaf aviator-mogul Howard Hughes, immortalized in the Oscar-nominated movie "The Aviator"?</p><p>As in Hughes's case, it's hard to feel much sympathy for Wintour, who was born into privilege and has refused to relinquish it for a nanosecond. (When her East Village sublet was overrun by cockroaches in 1978, Oppenheimer reports, she fled in a taxi, never to return.) Her mother was a bespectacled Bostonian social worker who never got over the accidental death of her eldest son, and whose rural American relatives are treated like hired help by adult Anna (or so they complain); her father was the renowned London newspaper editor Charles "Chilly Charlie" Wintour, a bit of a Black Jack Bouvier type who later remarried one Audrey Slaughter. (One of the many pleasures of the Wintours' tale is how densely populated it is with outlandishly named, British bodice-ripper-sounding characters: Drusillas and Isabellas and Georginas. Nearly everybody is quoted in swooping italics, which enhances the effect.)</p><p>After his daughter scorned traditional schooling -- the mean teachers weren't thrilled about that penchant for miniskirts -- Daddy Wintour helped her get a couple of career breaks, beginning with a stint as a shopgirl at Biba, the boutique of London's swinging '60s. You might need to be a serious media or fashion wonk to appreciate Oppenheimer's meticulous tracing of the single-minded career arc that followed, the most titillating revelation of which might be that Wintour put in time at a now defunct sister magazine to Penthouse -- a fact she later deftly excised from her r�sum�. Amid the hirings and firings and photo shoots, we find a newsflash: The Vogue editor can be demanding in the workplace! To achieve her current perch, it appears, she harnessed "unvarnished ambition" -- still, incredibly, a slur when applied to women. The overall impression is almost as cartoonish as that sketched in The Devil Wears Prada, a roman � clef by Wintour's former assistant Lauren Weisberger.</p><p>If only for its verisimilitude, Front Row is an infinitely more satisfying Wintour treatise than that limply plotted bestseller; if Weisberger's heroine had taken a week off to groove at a Bob Marley concert, no one would've believed it. But the text could have used a little judicious airbrushing. Oppenheimer is fond of slipping jarringly into hipster colloquialisms like "way cool" and "freaking" -- more suitable to a contributor to Vogue's extremely successful teen spinoff edition than to a veteran biographer. He fails to acknowledge that even if you hate what Vogue represents, in its current incarnation it's a very, very good magazine; delicious in its unapologetic elitism and strong if fantastical point of view, a pleasure to page through every month. And he attributes the phrase "give them what they never knew they needed" to Wintour's predecessor, Grace Mirabella, without crediting the inspiration of Mirabella's predecessor, the flamingly iconic Diana Vreeland. </p><p>Reviewed by Alexandra Jacobs <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

They're the professional polarizers and the unhinged activists, the hardcore haters and the paranoid conspiracy theorists. They're people who always try to divide us instead of unite us. And at a time when the fringe is blurring with the base, they've hijacked American politics.<br><br>The Obama era has been a boom-time for Wingnuts, kicked off by a financial collapse and the election America's first black president.

But bolstered by the rise of hyper-partisan media, the Wingnut echo chamber is more influential than ever before and it has led directly to the division and dysfunction in Congress.

Itten had a considerable effect on the Bauhaus&#x2019;s creative training program, and his insights into the theory of colors set standards in art and design education that are still in use today. Constantly in dialogue with students and colleagues, Itten created works in which he examined the aura, contrasts, and forms of color. Inspired by his own teacher Adolf H�lzel, Itten developed a famous doctrine of color types whose significance extended far beyond the realms of fine art into everyday culture.

How we react to the ups and downs of life makes all the difference, and Buddhism offers a wealth of wisdom and practices to help us maintain a stable, wise, and helpful state of mind no matter what happens. <br><br> <i>In the Face of Fear</i> shows us how to <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;remain open, joyful, and caring, even when life is stressful<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; avoid old behavior patterns that only make things worse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; access our innate confidence and fearlessness<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; turn difficult times into opportunities for spiritual development<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;learn why caring for others is the best way to relieve our own suffering<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;discover that our true nature is always awake, wise, and good, no matter what is happening<br>This anthology features the greatest contemporary Buddhist teachers and writers&#x2014;people renowned for addressing precisely the problems we&#x2019;re facing today&#x2014;including the Dalai Lama, Pema Ch�dr�n, Thich Nhat Hanh, Ch�gyam Trungpa, Sylvia Boorstein, Jack Kornfield, Norman Fischer, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Sharon Salzberg, and many others.</p><p>Barry Boyce is a member of the Denma Translation Group and has taught seminars on <i>The Art of War</i>. He is a senior editor and staff writer for the <i>Shambhala Sun</i> magazine.Editors of the <i>Shambhala Sun</i> magazine have culled writing from Buddhist luminaries to address the fear and suffering affecting many lives. This collection includes excerpts from older works as well as more recent essays. Contributors reflect the dominant forms of Buddhism in the United States: Tibetan (including His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the late Ch�gyam Trungpa Rinpoche), the <i>vipassana</i> movement (Sylvia Boorstein, Joseph Goldstein), and Zen (Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, Zoketsu Norman Fischer). Buddhist practice does not offer an end to change, loss, or even pain, magazine editor-in-chief Melvin McLeod writes. What we can change is the way we react. Emphasizing the basic Buddhist tenet of accepting impermanence, contributors examine many facets of fear and offer such tools as mindfulness, faith, patience, humor, and loving-kindness to promote healing. Particularly acute are Matthieu Ricard's meditations on optimism and Jack Kornfield's parsing of the misunderstood concept of desire in Buddhism. Containing 33 essays, this book should be dipped into rather than read cover to cover because of the repetitiveness of its themes. No raging against fate in this compendium of gentle wisdom. <i>(Nov. 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many had forgotten at what great peril the freedom of their faith had been won. In the large Catechism Luther set out to inculcate the centrality of the gospel that was largely neglected and whose freedom was frequently abused.Martin Luther (1483, 1546) was a German monk, a theologian and church reformer, he is considered to be the founder of Protestantism. Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.</p><h2>Ensnared (Splintered Series #3)</h2><p>After surviving a disastrous battle at prom, Alyssa has embraced her madness and gained perspective.

G. Howard wrote <i>Splintered</i> while working at a school library. She always wondered what would&#x2019;ve happened had the subtle creepiness of <i>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</i> taken center stage, and she hopes her darker and funkier tribute to Carroll will inspire readers to seek out the stories that won her heart as a child. She lives in Amarillo, Texas.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;Alyssa may have survived the epic battle at end of Unhinged (Abrams, 2014), but things are still looking grim. Her mom is trapped in Wonderland while both of her love interests, human Jeb and magical Morpheus, are stuck in AnyElsewhere, a horrifying in-between world full of outcasts and mutants. Accompanied by her father, Alyssa must prepare to do final battle with the Red Queen while rescuing her loves. But when it turns out that Jeb and Morpheus have their own agendas, Alyssa is heartbroken by each in turn, leaving her unhinged as she enters the final ordeal. Though the story is convoluted and the writing overblown, this series has gained traction among teens. Fans are highly invested in the Morpheus-Alyssa-Jeb love triangle, and most should be happy with how Howard resolves the series. Librarians feeding a strong interest in goth-fantasy-romances may wish to take a second look at the trilogy. Otherwise, this conclusion is recommended only where the first books were popular.&#x2014;Eliza Langhans, Hatfield Public Library, MA</p><h2>Wages of Rebellion</h2><p>Revolutions come in waves and cycles. We are again riding the crest of a revolutionary epic, much like 1848 or 1917, from the Arab Spring to movements against austerity in Greece to the Occupy movement. In <i>Wages of Rebellion</i>, Chris Hedges&#x2014;who has chronicled the malaise and sickness of a society in terminal moral decline in his books <i>Empire of Illusion</i> and <i>Death of the Liberal Class</i>&#x2014;investigates what social and psychological factors cause revolution, rebellion, and resistance. Drawing on an ambitious overview of prominent philosophers, historians, and literary figures he shows not only the harbingers of a coming crisis but also the nascent seeds of rebellion. Hedges' message is clear: popular uprisings in the United States and around the world are inevitable in the face of environmental destruction and wealth polarization.<br><br>Focusing on the stories of rebels from around the world and throughout history, Hedges investigates what it takes to be a rebel in modern times. Utilizing the work of Reinhold Niebuhr, Hedges describes the motivation that guides the actions of rebels as sublime madness&#x201d; the state of passion that causes the rebel to engage in an unavailing fight against overwhelmingly powerful and oppressive forces. For Hedges, resistance is carried out not for its success, but as a moral imperative that affirms life. Those who rise up against the odds will be those endowed with this sublime madness.&#x201d;<br><br>From South African activists who dedicated their lives to ending apartheid, to contemporary anti-fracking protests in Alberta, Canada, to whistleblowers in pursuit of transparency, Wages of Rebellion shows the cost of a life committed to speaking the truth and demanding justice. Hedges has penned an indispensable guide to rebellion.</p><p>Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist. He spent nearly two decades as a correspondent in Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and the Balkans, with fifteen years at the &#34;New York Times.&#34; He is the author of numerous bestselling books, including &#34;Empire of Illusion&#34;; &#34;Death of the Liberal Class&#34;; &#34;War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning&#34;; and &#34;Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt,&#34; which he co-wrote with Joe Sacco.

We've all heard the controversy. The consensus regarding the age of the Earth, based on the best geological evidence, is that it is billions of years old. But many Christians believe that the Bible teaches the Earth is only a few thousand years old at best. What are we to make of this discrepancy? Geologists Davis Young and Ralph Stearley tackle this issue head-on. Thoroughly examining historical, biblical, geological and philosophical perspectives, the amply illustrated <em>Bible, Rocks and Time</em> takes a comprehensive and authoritative look at the key issues related to the Earth's antiquity.</p><p><strong>Davis A. Young</strong> (Ph.D., Brown University) is Professor Emeritus of Geology at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan."This book will prove a useful tool for scientists to explain geologic ideas to the public, and to refute the notion that accepting science necessarily means rejecting religion. It will be especially useful in communicating with evangelical Christians." (Steven Newton, Reports, 2009)<br><br>"Well written and comprehensive." (Hugh Henry, Stone Campbell Journal, Fall 2009)<br><br>"I am sorry that this book had to be written, but I am so glad that it was written and that it was done in such a splendid fashion." (Michael Ruse, Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, Spring 2009)<br><br>"Rigorously argued and well-documented." (Marcus R. Ross, Christianity Today, April 2009)<br><br>"It is remarkable to encounter a scientific treatise written in a very interesting style. One should not be intimidated by its 500-page length. One geologist says: "Every church librarian should have this volume available as an essential reference." We agree and are pleased to have a book of this caliber in our collection." (Betty Waller, The Lamplighter, May 2009)<br><br>"Saying that <em>The Bible, Rocks and Time</em> is probably the best book of its kind would not be saying enough, since there really is no other book of its kind: a treatment of the varied and overwhelmingly consistent evidence for the antiquity of our planet, written by Evangelical Christians with the aim of not only making the scientific case for the age of the Earth, but also helping conservative Christian readers navigate the issues of theology and Biblical interpretation that go along with such a conclusion, and all the while pointing out the difficulties and at times dishonesty of the young-earth creationist position. I highly recommend this book for any young earth creationist who is open to encountering an opposing viewpoint. I also recommend it for anyone who is unsure what to think about matters of science and creationism and wants more information. I heartily recommend this book -- all 510 pages of it!" (James F. McGrath, Exploring Our Matrix (exploringourmatrix.blogspot.com), April 23, 2009)<br><br>"This solidly researched book would be a useful reference for anyone interested in the broader issues of the historical development of geology and why geology supplanted the traditional biblical view of Earth history. While all geologists should read this book to learn more about the history of their field, it would be especially valuable for Christian school and seminary libraries as well as university libraries with history of science and religious studies departments." (S. H. Schimmrich, CHOICE, February 2009)<br><br>"These men know what they are talking about on this subject. They have put together a nice and readable presentation of the geological evidence for the age of the earth. This book is an excellent resource for and Pastor and any Christian struggling with the issue. I recommend [parts 1 and 2] to everyone interested in the debate and how we got to the current position, especially Pastors and church leaders.

That's a question that continues to haunt evangelicals, even in the 21st century. Suggestion: an adult Sunday school class at your church, using this book as a text. Invite professors from local colleges for some of the sessions. Yes, you will be asking people to read 500 pages. About geology. And at the end, they will agree it was time exceedingly well spent." (John Wilson, Christianity Today, December 2008)<br><br>"This book would be especially helpful for: <ul><li>Christian college students with a major or interest in science</li><li>Pastors and youth workers who need a viable, Biblically-sound alternative to young-Earth creationism</li><li>Non-believing scientists, doctors and engineers who reject Christianity because they think faith in Christ is incompatible with science</li><li>Anyone who has an interest in the relationship between science (especially geology) and the Bible</li></ul>" (The Geo Christian (geochristian.wordpress.com), September 11, 2008)</p><h2>History and Eschatology: Jesus and the Promise of Natural Theology</h2><p><p>The question of 'natural theology' interlocks with the related questions of whether we can conceive of God acting in the world at all, as well as why, if God is God, evil persists in the world. Can specific events in history, like those reported in the Gospels, afford the necessary point from which to ask and answer such questions? </p><p>Widely shared cultural and philosophical presumptions have conditioned our understanding of history in ways that truncate our epistemic horizons and make the idea of historical divine action problematic. But could better historical study itself win from ancient Jewish and Christian cosmology and eschatology a renewed account of knowledge by which to open up and reconsider the fundamental question of the relation of God and world for today?</p><p>Professor Wright argues that this can indeed be done, and in this ground-breaking book he develops a distinctive approach to natural theology grounded in an 'epistemology of love'. This approach arises from reflection upon the significance of the ancient concept of the 'new creation' for our understanding the reality of the world and the reality of God in relation to one another.</p><p><b>Provisional contents</b></p><p>1.

With his trademark bravura, Ryszard Kapuscinski went the other way, begging his was from Lisbon and comfort to Luanda&#x2014;once famed as Africa's Rio de Janeiro&#x2014;and chaos.Angola, a slave colony later given over to mining and plantations, was a promised land for generations of poor Portuguese. It had belonged to Portugal since before there were English-speakers in North America. After the collapse of the fascist dictatorship in Portugal in 1974, Angola was brusquely cut loose, spurring the catastrophe of a still-ongoing civil war. Kapuscinski plunged right into the middle of the drama, driving past thousands of haphazardly placed check-points, where using the wrong shibboleth was a matter of life and death; recording his imporessions of the young soldiers&#x2014;from Cuba, Angola, South Africa, Portugal&#x2014;fighting a nebulous war with global repercussions; and examining the peculiar brutality of a country surprised and divided by its newfound freedom.Translated from the Polish by William R. Brand and Katarzyna Mroczkowska-Brand.</p><p>Ryszard Kapuscinski is widely regarded as one of the twentieth century's preeminent journalists, demonstrating an almost mystical ability to discover the odd or overlooked and incorporating these sometimes surreal details into narratives that go beyond mere reportage and enter the realm of literature. <br>Another Day of Life" is Kapuscinski's dramatic account of the three months he spent in Angola at the beginning of its decades' long civil war. The capital, Luanda, is occupied only by those not fortunate enough to flee. When even the dogs abandoned by the Europeans leave, Kapuscinski decides to go to the front, where the wrong greeting could cost your life and where young soldiers-from Cuba, Russia, South Africa, Portugal-are fighting a war with global repercussions. With harrowing detail, Kapuscinski shows us the peculiar brutality of a country divided by its newfound freedom. <br>Translated from the Polish by William R. Brand and Katarzyna Mroczkowska-Brand.Ryszard Kapuscinski, Poland's most celebrated foreign correspondent, was born in 1932.

A. Henty (1832&#x2013;1903) wrote vastly popular, carefully researched books about fictional youngsters who lived during critical periods of history. In this exciting volume, he provides a thrilling glimpse of the struggle between Great Britain and Spain for supremacy of the high seas, as seen through the eyes of a sixteenth-century teenager, Ned Hearne.<br>Along with three friends, young Ned is swept up in one adventure after another as he accompanies the daring English mariner Francis Drake on amazing voyages of discovery across the Pacific. An eyewitness to the great naval battle between the English fleet and the Spanish Armada, Ned has firsthand views of England's rise as the world's most powerful sea-going nation. <br>A rousing, old-fashioned tale of ruthless life on the high seas, <i>Under Drake's Flag</i> introduces today's young readers to one of yesteryear's most widely read authors &#x2014; a writer whose many talents earned him the title&nbsp;Prince of Storytellers.</p><p>A storyteller who specialized in blending authentic historical facts with exciting fictional characters, Henty produced more than 140 books and achieved a reputation as &#34;The Prince of Storytellers.&#34; Immensely popular and widely used in schools for many years, Henty&#39;s novels continue to fire young imaginations with their spirited tales of adventure amid exciting historical times.In this old-fashioned tale of incredible escapades, a lad accompanies Sir Frances Drake on several amazing voyages. One of G.A. Henty's classic historical novels for children, this story also provides adults a glimpse of the exciting but ruthless life on the high seas and unexplored lands of the sixteenth century. Although Fred Williams's manner might be a good match for the stilted, formal style of this nineteenth-century work, it's not pleasant for the listener. He employs the same stiff-upper-lip tone throughout narrative, dialogue, and journal writings. A few attempts at vocal characterization are oddly chosen and inconsistent.The flawed production overshadows the charm and exhilaration of this historical adventure.

It made this Hebrew text finally available to English readers, and it gave us insights into the groundbreaking work that Kaplan did in orienting American Jews to the deep connection between ethical living and religious belief. It is no wonder that this book has become the centerpiece of the modern-day Mussar Movement, which inspires so many on their spiritual path. </p><p>Rabbi Ira Stone, consummate teacher and stirring speaker, is a major force in the resurgence of the Mussar Movement.

Contact Marie at marie@marieforce.com.The dual scandal ripped through the city with the power of a tsunami, flooding the airwaves with headlines that struck fear in Sam's heart. "Springer Alleges Farns-worth's Incompetence Caused Son's Death" and "Detective 'In Bed' with Judge on Custody Matter."<br><br>Sitting in front of the TV in the master bedroom, Sam hung on every word that was being said about her beloved chief of police, the man she'd known first as Uncle Joe. And her close friend, Detective Tommy "Gonzo" Gonzales, who'd been shot during the Springer investigation shortly after he'd been granted full and permanent custody of his young son Alex.<br><br>"Springer alleges that Farnsworth personally ordered the homicide investigation into the stabbing deaths of his younger son Hugo and eight of Hugo's friends be put on hold to allow for the conclusion of a six-month undercover narcotics investigation that had focused on Billy Springer and his associates." The talking head on CBC seemed to be taking great pleasure in reporting on the events that had led to Billy Springer's death at the hands of a Metro PD SWAT team.<br><br>"Are they going to mention how he shot at us?" Sam asked the TV. "Of course not. That won't be brought up."<br><br>"The department faces the secondary scandal surrounding Detective Sergeant Thomas Gonzales, who was shot in the neck by Springer during the confrontation at Springer's grandmother's house in Friendship Heights."<br><br>"Thank you!" Sam said. "Finally! Thanks for remembering Springer actually <em>shot</em> one of our people!"<br><br>"Gonzales's custody case was heard in the courtroom of Family Court Judge Leon Morton, the brother of Eva Morton, whose homicide case was investigated by none other than newly promoted Detective Thomas Gonzales. Neither the judge nor the detective disclosed their earlier connection, which is a conflict of interest, according to the attorney for the baby's mother, Lori Phillips."<br><br>"Oh my God, Gonzo," Sam whispered. She couldn't even think about what it would mean to Gonzo if he lost custody of the son he adored. "What a fucked-up mess."<br><br>"What's a fucked-up mess?" Sam's husband and the country's new vice president asked as he came into the bedroom where she sat at the end of the bed watching the news. It was one of two rooms in the house that wasn't being monitored by the Secret Service around the clock. The other was their loft on the top floor of the double-sized townhouse, the place they escaped to whenever they needed some time alone.<br><br>"Gonzo."<br><br>"What about him?" Nick asked.<br><br>"He failed to disclose an earlier connection to Judge Morton, who presided over Alex's custody hearing. He investigated the murder of Morton's sister years ago."<br><br>"Oh, damn."<br><br>"And now Lori and her lawyer are making a big stink out of the fact that they failed to disclose. She's taken her case to the media, and they're eating it up like the rabid dogs they are."<br><br>"Tommy must be freaking out."<br><br>"Yeah, I'm sure he is. And he's got enough on his mind with the wound taking forever to heal."<br><br>Sam blew out a deep breath to calm nerves that went nuts every time she relived the way the Springer investigation had blown up in their faces and how they would've lost Gonzo without his partner's quick action.<br><br>Sensing her disquiet, Nick came to her and wrapped his arms around her, which calmed her like always. "He's fine, Sam. A little battered but fine. And this thing with the judge will blow over when something bigger happens. You know how the news cycle in this city works."<br><br>Sam looped her arms around his waist and breathed in the rich, masculine scent of home. He was so beautiful with his brown hair that curled at the ends, the dark olive complexion that made him look tan, even in the dead of winter, and the hazel eyes that saw her like no one else before him ever had. "And this thing with the chief. I'm worried about it."<br><br>"How come? Everyone knows Springer is just spouting off because he doesn't want to accept that one of his sons killed another of his sons&#x2014;and a bunch of other kids too."<br><br>"I know, but what Springer is saying about Farnsworth. It's true. He did put the murder investigation on hold when it was zeroing in on Billy Springer because the narcs were completing a long-term undercover investigation and needed more time to sew it up."<br><br>"And that's unusual?"<br><br>"Nothing trumps murder. The whole thing was totally bizarre. We all thought so."<br><br>"Did he tell you why he made that call?"<br><br>"It was about money and the huge investment that'd already been made into the narcotics investigation. If nothing came of that outlay of cash, it would hurt us at budget time. Or something like that. And now it's coming back to bite him in the ass anyway."<br><br>"He's withstood worse. He'll get through this too."<br><br>Sam wanted to believe Nick was right, but she was worried nonetheless. "Ever since the chief put the murder investigation on ice, I've had a bad feeling about how it could come back to haunt us."<br><br>"So you're saying Springer has good reason to be pissed?"<br><br>"Well, not necessarily. His son was, in fact, a murderer, and what father ever wants to admit that? But Billy might still be alive&#x2014;and Gonzo never would've been shot&#x2014;if we'd arrested Billy the night before the standoff with SWAT. And we'd all like to know how he found out we were focusing on him. The entire thing was a fucking disaster."<br><br>"Are you still up for going out tonight?" Nick asked.<br><br>Sam forced herself to rally for his sake. He needed this night out more than she did, and she needed it pretty damn badly. "Of course I am. I've been living for date night with my sexy husband."<br><br>He rolled his eyes at her as he always did when she commented on his supreme hotness.<br><br>"Besides, I know it's taken a tremendous amount of coordination to make it happen, so I wouldn't dream of backing out."<br><br>At the reminder of the restrictions that came with his new job, his smile faded. "Yeah, it did. It takes a freaking act of Congress for me to be able to walk out the goddamn door."<br><br>He'd known, of course, that round-the-clock Secret Service protection would be confining. But knowing it and living it were two very different things. He'd had protection at the end of his recent campaign for the Senate after Sam's family had been threatened. However, Nick was finding a huge difference between having a detail as a candidate and having one as vice president. "Let me grab a quick shower and get changed," Sam said. "Where's Scotty?"<br><br>"He and Shelby are making pizza. Rumor has it her <em>boyfriend</em> will be joining them." FBI Special Agent Avery Hill was hardly her husband's favorite person, probably because of the not-so-secret crush he'd once had on her. "I'll be down in fifteen minutes."<br><br>"I'll be waiting." He left her with a kiss and headed downstairs to spend some time with Scotty before they left.<br><br>Sam rushed through a shower and changed into the sexy black cocktail dress she'd bought weeks ago with this evening in mind. It was their second New Year's Eve as a couple, and they were returning to the place where they'd gone last year to celebrate their new jobs&#x2014;hers as the lieutenant in charge of the Metro Police Department's Homicide Division and his as a newly sworn-in senator, taking the place of his slain best friend, John O'Connor.<br><br>She smoothed Nick's favorite lavender-and vanilla-scented lotion onto her arms and legs as she thought about him and the changes they'd all endured since he accepted President Nelson's offer to become his new vice president. While her life had remained more or less the same, Nick's had changed dramatically, and she could see him chafing against some of the restrictions.<br><br>For one thing, the insomnia that had plagued him for most of his adult life had been relentless in the last couple of weeks. For another, the constant, intrusive presence of his Secret Service detail was driving them both to drink. The director of the Secret Service had given them special permission to remain in their own Capitol Hill home, but the officers assigned to protect Nick were clearly put out by the directive. Not that any of them had said as much to Nick, but it was obvious to both of them that the detail didn't approve.<br><br>They'd much rather have the family living at the Naval Observatory in the traditional home of the vice president. But with Sam's dad three doors down from them and still recovering from his recent surgery to remove a bullet from his spinal cord, there was no way she could move. Nick had known that and had made remaining in their own home a condition of accepting the president's offer.<br><br>Thank God he'd also negotiated for no Secret Service protection for her, which allowed her to continue in her role as the lieutenant in charge of the MPD's Homicide Division. The thought of being trailed by a detail gave Sam the heebie-jeebies. So while she retained the freedom to come and go as she pleased, Nick and Scotty were under lock and key, which had been an adjustment for all of them.<br><br>As the cold winter weather had set in, they'd been content to spend many an evening at home during the holiday season, watching movies and playing round after round of Monopoly with Scotty, who was shaping up to be a real estate shark in the making. He won every game. Sam couldn't help but wonder, however, what would happen when her guys began to chafe at being stuck at home so much of the time.<br><br>"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it," she decided. For now, she was thrilled to have a romantic evening ahead of her with the love of her life. She secured the diamond key necklace he'd given her as a wedding gift and slid on the gorgeous engagement ring she only wore when she wasn't working. He'd told her he liked seeing it on her hand, so she wore it for him as often as possible.<br><br>In the room that served as her closet, she found a black wool coat that she tossed over her arm before she headed downstairs wearing the four-inch black Loubou-tin stunners with the red bottoms that Nick had bought her for Christmas. Her husband knew the way to her heart was through her shoes, and she'd found one hell of a way to thank him. She smiled when she remembered dropping to her knees before him&#x2014;while wearing only the shoes&#x2014;and the way his eyes had widened with surprise and then pure desire when he'd realized her intention.<br><br>As she entered the living room, the doorbell rang and the Secret Service agent working the door admitted Avery Hill, who stopped to give Sam the head-to-toe once-over before he cleared his throat and said hello.<br><br>She really wished he'd quit looking at her that way before Nick ran a rusty steak knife through the guy's heart. Wouldn't that make for some memorable headlines&#x2014;<em>Vice President Cappuano Charged with First-Degree, Premeditated Murder by Rusty Steak Knife of FBI Agent Who Lusted After His Wife. Story at eleven!</em><br><br>The thing about it, though, was that Hill was a trusted and valued colleague on the job, and he had a relationship that was starting to be long-term going with their friend and personal assistant, Shelby Faircloth. Yet every so often, he still looked at Sam like he wanted to kidnap her and drag her out of her happy home to be his sex slave.<br><br><em>Whoa.</em> Where the hell had the <em>sex slave</em> thought come from?<br><br>"Sam?" he asked, his brows furrowed. "Are you okay?"<br><br>"Yeah, sure. I'm fine. You?"<br><br>"Great. Good holiday?"<br><br>"Fantastic. You?"<br><br>"Very nice. The whole family was in Charleston for the first time in years."<br><br>Sam sucked at small talk, but she made an effort for Shelby's sake. She wanted Shelby to feel free to have any guest she wanted over to visit since she spent so much time at their house. Hill was at the top of Shelby's guest list, much to Nick's neverending dismay.<br><br>Speak of the devil. He came into the room, and his amiable expression instantly hardened when he saw that Hill had arrived. Nick put his arm around her and kissed her temple. Not for the first time, she was grateful he didn't lift his leg and pee on her to mark his territory in front of the agent.<br><br>"What do you think of this shit with Farnsworth and Gonzo?" Hill asked, apparently oblivious, as usual, to the fact that Nick would prefer that Hill didn't speak to his wife&#x2014;ever.<br><br>"I'm hoping it'll blow over when something bigger happens."<br><br>"Springer's out for blood. He's not going to be happy with anything less than Farnsworth's head on a stick."<br><br>Sam's stomach turned at the thought of anyone other than her beloved Uncle Joe as the chief of police.<br><br>"No sense speculating on what might happen," Nick said. "We've got somewhere to be. Are you ready, babe?" The Secret Service detail was hovering by the front door, waiting for the signal from Nick that they were set to go.<br><br>"Let me just say good-night to Scotty, and then I'll be ready."<br><br>"He's in the kitchen with Shelby."<br><br>Reluctant to leave Nick and Hill alone in a room together, she took hold of her husband's hand and tugged him along with her to the kitchen, where Scotty was making pizza with Shelby. At times like this, Sam felt like a total loser as a mother because it would never occur to her to make pizza from scratch when there were perfectly good take-out numbers to call. Fortunately, Scotty didn't seem to realize he'd landed a dud for a mother. He lit up at the sight of her and Nick the way he always did.<br><br>"Sam! Check it out! I tossed my own crust just like that chef guy on TV does it." He'd recently turned thirteen and had grown at least two inches since he came to live with them over the summer. A member of Scotty's Secret Service detail sat at the table reading the paper, sticking out despite his effort to be unobtrusive. They were all obtrusive, and Sam hated having them in her house. But the alternative of having Nick and Scotty unprotected was unthinkable.<br><br>"Looking good, buddy. If I tried that, the crust would be stuck to the ceiling."<br><br>Nick patted her shoulder. "It's best that you have your pizza delivered."<br><br>How did he always know what she was thinking? That was one of her life's most enduring mysteries.<br><br>"We're heading out," Nick said. "Are you guys all set with everything?"<br><br>"We're good," Shelby said, smiling at Hill, who hovered in the doorway.<br><br>Scotty nodded in agreement. "Yep."<br><br>"Give me a hug," Sam said.<br><br>"My hands are all dirty, and you look really nice," Scotty said. "I'll risk it."<br><br>He held his hands up and away from her while she gave him a squeeze and a kiss on the cheek. "Be good for Shelby."<br><br>"Duh, I'm always good."<br><br>And wasn't that the truth? He was a good and decent boy, and they were blessed to have him in their lives. If only they could get his adoption finalized, everything would be perfect. As required by the courts, they had a private investigator looking for Scotty's biological father, but so far their efforts hadn't yielded any results.<br><br>"Shelby said we can have champagne at midnight."<br><br>The tiny blonde Sam called Tinker Bell balked. "I said no such thing! Don't get me in trouble."<br><br>Scotty laughed at her outrage.<br><br>"I said you could stay <em>up</em> until midnight, but if you get me in trouble, it's off to bed with you right now."<br><br>"I'll behave," Scotty said gravely, a devilish glint in his eyes.<br><br>"Happy New Year," Nick said.<br><br>"Same to you," Shelby said. "Have a good time, and don't worry about anything here."<br><br>"Thanks, Shelby." With a hand placed possessively on her lower back, Nick ushered Sam from the kitchen.<br><br>Hill ducked out of the way to let them pass. "Happy New Year," he said.<br><br>"Same to you," Sam said while Nick remained...</p><h2>Iamblichus&#39; Life of Pythagoras</h2><p>Authentic memoirs of the life of Pythagoras--the father of philosophy and the inventor of geometry--hold the great interest for every lover of wisdom. Iamblichus' biography is universally acknowledged as deriving from sources of the highest antiquity. Its classic translation by Thomas Taylor was first printed in 1818 and is once again brought to light in this edition. <br> <br>During Iamblichus' life, the depth and sublimity of his writing and discourse attracted a multitude of associates and disciples from all parts of the world. The Emperor Julian wrote of him, "that he was posterior indeed in time, but not in genius, to Plato," and all the Platonists who succeeded him honored him with the epithet of "divine." <br> <br>Iamblichus' account of the life of Pythagoras begins with the great philosopher's birth on the island of Samos, his youth, and his wide renown in Greece. It briefly covers his early travels and his studies with the philosophers Anaximander and Thales, his twenty-two years of instruction in the temples of Egypt, and his initiation into the Egyptian and Babylonian mysteries. The later life and work of Pythagoras are richly elaborated, with humorous and profound anecdotes illustrating his philosophy and providing a unique view of community life under his tutelage in Crotona. <br> <br>Included are excerpts from his teachings on harmonic science, dietetic medicine, friendship, temperance, politics, parenthood, the soul's former lives and many other topics. The book also contains substantial sections on the Fragments of the Ethical Writings (the work of very early Pythagoreans) and the Pythagoric Sentences.</p><p>The translator of this work, Thomas Taylor, is known for his authoritative translations of the Platonists; he was practically the sole source of Neo-Platonic thought in the transcendentalist movement of New England. Iamblichus' <i>Life of Pythagoras</i> was a constant source of inspiration to the transcendentalists and a major influence on their writings throughout the Nineteenth Century.

Childhood playmates in Beech Green, they would remain close throughout their long lives, eventually sharing a cottage in their retirement. They felt grief when a village family was lost on the Titanic. They each experienced young love and then heartbreak when the First World War interrupted both of their romances. The triumphs and tragedies of their days are depicted with all the humor, heartbreak, and human warmth for which Miss Read is known, providing a sensitive portrait of life in the country.</p><p><p><b>Miss Read</b> (1913-2012) was the pseudonym of Mrs. Dora Saint, a former schoolteacher beloved for her novels of English rural life, especially those set in the fictional villages of Thrush Green and Fairacre. The first of these, <i>Village School</i>, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature.&nbsp;</p>"One somehow expects Peter Rabbit to pop out of one of Miss Read's thatched cottages, and start chatting up the various apple-checked parties who staff this Beatrix Potter world."

His science-based plan blends the healthy components of the traditional Mediterranean diet with the ease and effectiveness of low-carb eating. Conquer Diabetes and Prediabetes: The Low-Carb Mediterranean Diet teaches how to lower blood sugars naturally, reduce or eliminate diabetic medications, and lose excess weight if needed. Type 2 diabetics and prediabetics have lost the ability to process carbohydrates safely. Carbohydrates have become poisonous for them. Carb toxicity too often leads to numb and painful limbs, impaired vision, kidney failure, amputations, cancer, and premature heart attacks, strokes, and death. Nutrition experts worldwide agree that the Mediterranean diet is the healthiest way of eating for the general public. It prolongs life and reduces rates of heart attack, stroke, cancer, and dementia. The only problem for diabetics is that it provides too many toxic carbohydrates. Dr. Parker initially recommends a very-low-carb ketogenic diet for 12 to 18 weeks, then teaches the reader how to gradually add more healthy carbohydrates depending on blood sugar and body weight changes. Due to the toxic nature of carbohydrates in people with impaired blood sugar metabolism, most diabetics won&#x2019;t be able to tolerate more than 80-100 grams of carbohydrate daily. (The average Western diet provides 250 grams.) The book provides recipes, a week of menus, instruction on exercise, discussion of all available diabetic medications, advice on prevention of weight regain, lists of delicious doctor-approved foods, 71 scientific references, an annotated bibliography, and an index. All measurements are given both in U.S. customary and metric units.</p><p>Steve Parker, M.D., is a leading medical expert on the Mediterranean diet and author of the award-winning "Advanced Mediterranean Diet: Lose Weight, Feel Better, Live Longer." He has over two decades&#x2019; experience practicing Internal Medicine and treating patients with diabetes and prediabetes.

Based on the freshest ingredients and cooked from the heart, Greg and Lucy Malouf's approach to vegetarian food comes from their love of traditional Middle Eastern flavor combinations. The recipes in <em>New Feast</em> are new interpretations of Middle Eastern food, inspired by the spirit of generosity and sharing that characterizes the region. Think glazed apple-raisin fritters, zucchini blossom and preserved lemon risotto with ricotta and parmesan or griddled broccolini with almonds and harissa butter. With sections dedicated to butters and preserves, cooked vegetable dishes, dips and spreads, pickles and relishes, pastries, pastas, salads, grains and legumes &#x2013; this is a beautiful cookbook for anyone wanting to take vegetarian cuisine to new, flavorsome heights.</p><p>Acclaimed as the creator of a new style of cooking known as Modern Middle Eastern, Michelin-starred chef GREG MALOUF has been honored as Ambassador by The American University in Beirut for his achievements in promoting Lebanese cuisine around the world.

Middle Eastern food has always been delicious, but for the most part it goes on unchanged from generation to generation. ... Greg Malouf, an Australian of Lebanese ancestry, has cast a new eye on every Middle Eastern dish he cooks. ...The food is transformed, but somehow it retains the integrity of the original recipe. Everything comes to the table looking like a piece of art, and it ends up tasting even better than it looks. ...Every restaurant in Morocco offers pastila, layers of thin pastry stuffed with pigeon. Mr. Malouf substitutes rabbit for the pigeon, and devises as flaky and tasty a pastry as has ever emerged from an oven. The result is one of the most magnificent dishes I&#x2019;ve eaten.

As 18-year-old Sid Luckman made headlines across New York City for his high school football exploits at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, his father, Meyer Luckman, was making headlines in the same papers for a very different reason: the gangland murder of his own brother-in-law. Amazingly, when Sid became a star at Columbia and a Hall of Fame NFL quarterback in Chicago, all of it while Meyer Luckman served 20-years-to-life in Sing Sing Prison, the connection between sports celebrity son and mobster father was studiously ignored by the press and ultimately overlooked for eight decades.<p><i>Tough Luck</i> traces two simultaneous historical developments through a single immigrant family in Depression-era New York: the rise of the National Football League led by the dynastic Chicago Bears, whose famed owner George Halas convinced Sid Luckman to help him turn the sluggish game of pro football into America&#x2019;s favorite pastime; and the demise&#x2015;triggered by Meyer Luckman&#x2019;s crime and initial coverup&#x2015;of the Brooklyn labor rackets and Louis Lepke&#x2019;s infamous organization Murder, Inc.

When the girl notices a num ber tattooed on her grandfather's arm, her grandfather tells her of the atroc ities committed by the Nazis against the Jews, even describing Auschwitz, the camp he was in. ``We were no longer people to them. We were numbers.'' Moved, the young girl comforts her grandfather. The deceptively simple vocabulary does not limit the dignity of the text. Because of the subject matter, this would work best when presented by an adult with preparatory and fol low-up discussion, but it offers just enough information and emotion for primary grade children to handle. That this really happened to a beloved grand father makes the horror more immedi ate and realistic, and offers a different approach than the more allegorical one taken in Promise of a New Spring (Ros sell, 1981) by Gerda Klein.

And are Christians really prepared for the answers? In Mere Discipleship, Lee Camp sets forth his vision of what it means to truly follow Christ, challenging Christians to put obedience to Jesus as Lord ahead of allegiances to all earthly authorities be they nationalistic, political, economic, or cultural. Camp clearly lays out a sound biblical framework of what disciples believe and therefore what they should do. This substantially revised and expanded second edition updates examples, adds chapter introductions and summaries, and includes new study questions.</p><p>This substantially revised and expanded edition contains added chapter introductions and summaries, an extensive study guide, and a reading guide.<br><br>"Part primer in radical discipleship, part Christian manifesto for our times, <i>Mere Discipleship</i> calls believers to a way of life formed by the 'costly grace' of the gospel.

I enthusiastically recommend this book for everyone who is seeking a more faithful and adventurous discipleship."--<b>Charles L. Campbell</b>, Columbia Theological Seminary<br><br>"A book for our times. It provides an accessible and reliable account of the biblical Christian message, and a vital critique of the cultural captivity and far-reaching disloyalty to Christ that have so frequently disfigured the church's witness in the world since the days of Constantine.

Marshall</b>, Victoria University of Wellington<br><br>"This is a blueprint for what would happen if Jesus's followers actually took him seriously today.

In<i> Islands of Destiny</i>, acclaimed historian and military intelligence expert John Prados points out that the Japanese forces quickly regained strength after Midway and continued their assault undaunted.</b><br><br> Taking this surprising fact as the start of his inquiry, he began to investigate how and when the Pacific tide turned in the Allies&#x2019; favor. Using archives of WWII intelligence reports from both sides, Prados offers up a compelling reassessment of the true turning in the Pacific: not Midway, but the fight for the Solomon Islands.<br><br> Combat in the Solomons saw a series of surface naval battles, including one of the key battleship-versus-battleship actions of the war; two major carrier actions; daily air duels, including the aerial ambush in which perished the famous Japanese naval commander Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku; and many other hair-raising exploits. Commencing with the Allied invasion of Guadalcanal, Prados shows how and why the Allies beat Japan on the sea, in the air, and in the jungles.</p><p><b>Dr. John Prados</b> is a Senior Research Fellow on national security, including foreign affairs, intelligence, and military subjects, at the National Security Archive.

M. Stirling</b> is the author of many science fiction and fantasy novels. A former lawyer and an amateur historian, he lives in the Southwest with his wife, Jan.Chapter One<br><br>Participatory Democracy of Topanga (Formerly Topanga Canyon) <br>26th Change Year 46/Shohei 1/2044 AD<br><br>Prince John Arminger Mackenzie stood and sweated in his suit of chrome-steel plate, glad of the shade of the raised visor that stuck out from his flared sallet helm like the bill of the ritual cap baseball players wore. The fierce southland sun glittered off the rocky ground and sank into the faded asphalt of the ancient roadway and blinked in endless sparkles from the surface of the Pacific to the southward.<br><br>There was a familiar smell of hot horse, hot human, sweat-soaked leather and metal greased with canola oil that always went slightly rancid, a composite scent common to wherever warriors gathered, no matter how polished their appearance; it was fairly powerful since his sister, their men-at-arms and crossbowmen and Mackenzie archers and McClintock caterans, the Japanese contingent and several hundred local levies from Topanga and the Chatsworth Lancers were all standing and sweltering together. The score of robed <i>bnei Yaakov</i> from the Mojave were a little to one side-a people apart-but their mounts added hot camel to the mix, which was indescribable.<br><br>Despite the tension of the moment as everyone stared out over the water towards the quartet of enemy ships, he smiled to himself, remembering his parents inspecting troops once. That had also been on a hot day, in the County Palatine of Walla-Walla far up the Columbia. There had been a rather sheltered town-based cleric with them and he'd asked what the smell was. His mother had considered gravely for a moment, and said:<br><br>"Esprit de corps."<br><br>She'd said it deadpan, but he'd noticed his father working hard at not bellowing with laughter.<br><br>Today that familiar almost-stink went with the odd alien scents of fennel and sage that summer baked out of the chaparral here, harsh and spicy at once.<br><br><i>We're back in the stewpot just when we thought the adventure was over with</i>, he thought. <i>Though everything's grist for the mill</i>.<br><br>He was a prince and warrior by birth-second child of the first High King and Queen of Montival-but a troubadour and bard by aspiration, and he could appreciate the irony of the situation from an artistic point of view. They'd dared the desert and the supernatural perils of the Valley of Death . . .<br><br><i>Well, to be entirely fair, mostly Orrey and Reiko dared them in that last bit. Good ensemble cast, some comic relief from the heroic characters' points of view, someone for the groundlings to identify with too . . .</i><br><br>. . . they'd reclaimed the fabled Grass-Cutting Sword that their Nihonjin friends had crossed the sea to find, made unexpected allies of the desert-dwelling <i>bnei Yaakov </i>to bring it back through the desert and the just-barely-friendly lands of the Chatsworth Lancers and the Topangans . . . and now four enemy ships were sitting out there waiting for them, instead of the clear passage back to the northern heartlands of the realm that they'd expected.<br><br>It would make an excellent startling reverse in the epical chanson he'd tentatively entitled <i>The Desert and the Blade</i>. A quiet interlude in the music, then a hint of doubt, minor key, crashing chords building to a crescendo-<br><br><i>Artistically fine. In my all too mortal person, it's a bloody menace. Not to mention those ugly-looking Eaters the Koreans have picked up from the Los Angeles ruins.</i><br><br>The locals had a powerful pre-Change telescope set up. One look had been enough. The Korean vessels swarmed with the naked savages, scrawny and scarred and ferocious as great rats among the ordered, armored easterners. The diabolists could control them, somehow.<br><br><i>This bunch look even worse than the ones we fought up on the Bay, and those were bad enough.</i><br><br>He swallowed and blinked as the stink came back, and the screaming faces and the ugly feel of edged metal hammering into meat and bone vibrated up into his hand. And the taste, when a gout of blood landed on his face. He hadn't had time to be frightened during the actual fighting, mostly that had been drilled reflex working.<br><br>But the times in between the rushes waiting for the wild men to work themselves up to another attack and listening to their mad squealing brabble . . . that had been fairly bad. Having to keep up appearances had helped, and so had giving everyone some verses from <i>La Chanson deu Roland</i>. He found that a bravura gesture could convince one's own mind just as thoroughly as it did an audience.<br><br><i>And the Koreans may not be savages, but they're outright diabolists. Or at least their rulers and lords are.</i><br><br>His eyes narrowed. It had been servants of the Korean ruler who killed his father the High King only a few months ago, a spillover of their long war with Dai-Nippon, and a chess-move in the game Heaven and the Malevolence were playing in the Changed world. There was a blood-debt yet unpaid. <i>That </i>would be part of the song too.<br><br>"Reiko, can I borrow your Captain Ishikawa, and his men?" Crown Princess �rlaith said.<br><br>John's ears perked; when his older sister . . .<br><br>. . . <i>three years older. I'm</i> almost <i>twenty and it's not as if we were children anymore </i>. . .<br><br>. . . adopted that crisp tone, things were about to happen. She sounded like their father when she used it, allowing for her being a woman of twentyone and not a man in his forties.<br><br>The Empress of Dai-Nippon nodded decisively, and spoke a word of command to her followers. She was actually a little older than �rlaith, though her almost-delicate features made some layer of his mind see her as closer to his own nineteen summers. He'd been half in love with her since they met at Montinore Manor in June, when his sister had brought him into the conspiracy. It was more or less required of a young knight when confronted with a beautiful, absolutely unobtainable foreign princess. The romaunts made that clear enough. And of course her father had died in the same skirmish as his, just too late for rescue. He hadn't been there, she had, and somehow that made her a link to that tremendous absence, the loss that still broke through the shell of his life at times with a jarring suddenness that he never expected.<br><br>In actual fact as opposed to aesthetic theory he found her very capable, and very likeable on the rare occasions when she relaxed . . . and more than a little intimidating.<br><br>"Johnnie," �rlaith went on in a clipped tone.<br><br>Her chiseled face was utterly intent as she weighed the situation. The cooler sea-breeze cuffed at the little wisps of sun-faded yellow hair that escaped her tightly-clubbed fighting braid; she took more after their father's side of the family, while he had the hazel eyes and brown hair and blunter features of the Armingers. She was also an inch taller that he was, but since that made him a very respectable five-ten he didn't mind.<br><br><i>Come to think about it, she's getting very focused too. Granted this is a good time for it.</i><br><br>They'd always been fairly close, and the gap in their ages mattered less now. He gave her the Associate salute, a martial clank of gauntlet against breastplate.<br><br>"Take Ishikawa and the Nihonjin sailors, and go there."<br><br>She pointed westward and downslope from the low ridge that bore the old coast road.<br><br>"There are some longboats at the Topangans' saltworks. Take them, and . . . the crossbowmen from the Protector's Guard, and a few others, say four, pick them yourself. Feldman's short-handed; you reinforce him. And tell him to be cooperating fully with the <i>Stormrider</i>."<br><br>He shot her a swift look of surprise; for weeks now they'd been dodging the Royal Montivallan Navy warship their mother had sent to drag them back as if they were naughty toddlers to be hauled in by one ear. And there it was, to seaward of Captain Feldman's <i>Tarshish Queen</i>, their own hired ship, which in turn was slowly cruising back and forth south of the four Korean ships at anchor just offshore.<br><br>�rlaith stepped closer and spoke softly; there was no need to broadcast the facts about their little disagreement with their mother, High Queen Regnant Mathilda.<br><br>"Johnnie, Reiko <i>has</i> her Sacred Treasure the now. We've done what we set out to do. Now we clear this up, go back to Mother, roll on our backs, wave our paws in the air and whimper for forgiveness. We'll get it, too. Eventually."<br><br>He didn't let the jolt of raw fear that image brought show on his face.<br><br><i>I knew we'd have to confront Mother eventually. Ah, well, better to seek forgiveness than ask permission! And we </i>did<i> bring it off. Success has a thousand fathers and failure's an orphan.</i><br><br>"She'll recognize a magic sword when she sees one!" his sister said, echoing his thought.<br><br>Her hand rested on the moon-crystal pommel of the Sword of the Lady, the heirloom of their House that their father and mother had won on the Quest.<br><br>"So will anyone with the least bit of the Sight, without Reiko having to do anything too . . . dramatic."<br><br>John gave the not-really-a-katana-anymore at Reiko's side a glance and suppressed an impulse to cross himself. The Sword of the Lady was disturbing enough, but his Church officially regarded it as the gift of the Lady, Mary Queen of Heaven and Mother of God, which pagans like his father and sister unfortunately conflated with their mythology. Coming from a mixed family could be awkward at times; his mother was a devout Catholic, and he was too or tried to be, but �rlaith followed the Old Faith as their father had. It wasn't like having the old wars of Clan and Association in the same household-the union of their parents had laid that to rest, with many other feuds-but it could be . . . difficult.<br><br><i>Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi</i>, the Grass-Cutting Sword, was something else entirely, altogether outside Montival's complex of religions and all their mixed history and old grudges and sometimes grudging common life. As far as he could tell from what �rlaith and Reiko had let slip, the pieces of it had been absorbed into her Masamune sword as the Empress fought her way through that lost castle and his sister stood guard outside with the Lady's blade. There had been something about a monster with eight heads as well. . . .<br><br>Deor Godulfson was standing close. The wiry Hraefnbeorg poet nodded. Among his folk, a scop was likely to know something of rune-craft too, the arts of magic reborn since the Change. The angular raven image on his round shield wasn't just the symbol of his people, but also of Woden Allfather, and a protective sign.<br><br>"It <i>burns</i>," he said. "Like carrying the very sun in your hand . . ."<br><br>John nodded himself, giving it a glance. He felt it like a prickling on the skin. A little like the feeling of the Sword of the Lady, but . . . he could hold the Sword; he didn't like to, but it was in his blood and if his sister fell-<i>which God forfend</i>!-he would have to bear it.<br><br><i>Kusanagi </i>was wholly alien.<br><br>"Then why not just have everyone go out to the <i>Tarshish Queen</i> and show them our heels?" he said quietly to his sister and liege-lady. "<i>Stormrider</i> would be glad to escort us back to Portland, since that was what Mother tasked them with in the first place."<br><br>She shook her head. "They've some on those Korean ships who could sense Reiko and me moving, given what we bear," she said.<br><br>The enemy called their adepts kangshinmu, and John swallowed at the thought of meeting one again. Especially on his own. As their father's heir �rlaith carried the Sword of the Lady, which was proof against all fell enchantments and a great deal else besides. All he had was his own entirely mortal and fallible self and a length of very skillfully reworked leaf-spring at his side; and while he was a faithful son of Mother Church, he didn't delude himself that he was any sort of saint, or as armored in sanctity as he was in plate.<br><br><i>I'm the son of a great hero-King and a great and powerful Queen</i>, he thought as he pulled out his crucifix and kissed it before tucking it away again. <i>What I am myself . . . isn't entirely apparent yet. There would be better ways of finding out than being thrown in over my head, though!</i><br><br>�rlaith went on: "They'd be waiting for us on the water, that they would. For you, not so much."<br><br>Deor Godulfson made a soft sound of agreement at that, too; and John remembered how he'd tracked the Haida shaman at the battle on the shores of the Bay.<br><br>"Also I'm not inclined to leave our new subjects in the lurch," �rlaith said, and tapped her titanium-sabaton-armored foot on the dusty faded asphalt with a clank.<br><br>Her voice rang. "This is Montivallan soil now, and by Macha Red-Locks and Nemain of the Blood-Shout and Badb of the Crows, these are our folk, every one of them, and House Artos stands with them! The Shadow Queen bear witness!"<br><br>John nodded; he agreed with every word of that, barring the paganism, and he knew that she meant it too. But there was an element of performance to ruling. He'd been surprised to find so many similarities to the family business he'd been raised in when he also took up music seriously.<br><br><i>Except that if you're born to our House, you never get to step away from the limelights and sit backstage laughing with a glass in your hand and a towel around your neck.</i><br><br>Now he saluted again and decided:<br><br>"Deor, Thora, Evrouin, you're with me. Sergeant Fayard, your squad. Captain Ishikawa. Thora, get mounted and scout ahead. Let's go!"<br><br>Deor was a valuable asset for a whole clutch of skills, and the scop's oath-sister Thora Garwood of the Bearkillers was a warrior's warrior who went where he did . . . and neither of them was part of a larger unit that would be disrupted by tagging along with him, and besides, he liked them both.<br><br><i>Though not in the same way!</i><br><br>Evrouin, John's valet-bodyguard-minder, wasn't going to go more than arm's length from his charge anyway: they hadn't been able to shed him when they skipped out to begin all this, despite vigorous efforts. Before they'd gone more than a dozen paces someone else dashed up; it was one of the young Mackenzies who'd come on the journey with them, Ruan Chu Mackenzie of Dun Fairfax. He and Deor embraced fiercely for an instant, and they were both grinning as they caught up.</p><h2>Shetland: Cooking on the Edge of the World</h2><p>Shetland is where Scotland meets Scandinavia and the North Sea hits the Atlantic Ocean. Isolated, unspoilt and rich in history and tradition, Shetland is a truly singular place. James Morton grew up there. Co-written with his father, broadcaster and journalist Tom Morton, Shetland: Cooking on the Edge of the World explores life on an island with food, drink and community at its heart. Surrounded by crystal-clear waters, Shetland seafood is second to none, and butter and cheese are made locally. The native lamb roams freely around the island, and the Shetland black potato cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Here cooks, farmers, crofters and fishermen toil following traditions that go back hundreds of years. The recipes take in the very best that the isles have to offer, from celebratory feasts (the tradition of &#39;foy&#39;) through the food of the sea mackerel, mussels, salmon to treasures from the land (lamb, venison, beef) and earth. There&#39;s cooking born from necessity and thrift smoking and preserving (home-smoked halibut, pickles) and it simply wouldn&#39;t be Scottish without baking (bannocks, oatcakes, afternoon cakes and biscuits) and, of course, a wee dram. With spectacular photography throughout, and features on crofting, pit feasting and the annual Fire Festival, Up Helly Aa (which culminates in the burning of a Viking galley ship), Shetland: Cooking on the Edge of the World celebrates a very different kind of island paradise.</p><p>James Morton is the author of books including Brew (2016) and Brilliant Bread, which won the Guild of Food Writers Cookbook of the Year award in 2014. In 2012 he reached the final of BBC TV&#39;s Great British Bake Off. He works as a doctor in Glasgow, owns a brewery in the city, and has won several national home brewing awards. Tom Morton is a writer and broadcaster. He hosted his own show on BBC Radio Scotland for 20 years and is a former journalist on publications including the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Sunday Herald and New Statesman. Tom is the author of Shetland: Tales from the Last Bookshop, and lives in Shetland. He is James&#39;s dad.</p><h2>Montana: A History of Two Centuries</h2><p>Montana: A History of Two Centuries first appeared in 1976 and immediately became the standard work in its field.

Chaos is evolving from a scientific theory into a cultural metaphor. As a metaphor it allows us to query some of our most cherished assumptions and encourages us to ask fresh questions about reality. </p><p>Our modern society has been obsessed with conquering and scientifically controlling the world around us. However, chaotic, nonlinear systems - such as nature, society, and our individual lives - lie beyond all our attempts to predict, manipulate, and control them. Chaos suggests that instead of resisting life's uncertainties, we should embrace the possibilities they offer. </p><p>In this groundbreaking new book, John Briggs and F.

When Brautigan took his own life in September of 1984 his close friends and network of artists and writers were devastated though not entirely surprised. To many, Brautigan was shrouded in enigma, erratic and unpredictable in his habits and presentation. But his career was formidable, an inspiration to young writers like William Hjortsberg trying to get their start. Brautigan&#x2019;s career wove its way through both the Beat-influenced San Francisco Renaissance in the 1950s and the Flower Power&#x201d; hippie movement of the 1960s; while he never claimed direct artistic involvement with either period, <i>Jubilee Hitchhiker</i> also delves deeply into the spirited times in which he lived.<br><br>As Hjortsberg guides us through his search to uncover Brautigan as a man the reader is pulled deeply into the writer&#x2019;s world. Ultimately this is a work that seeks to connect the Brautigan known to his fans with the man who ended his life so abruptly in 1984 while revealing the close ties between his writing and the actual events of his life. Part history, part biography, and part memoir, <i>Jubilee Hitchhiker</i> etches the portrait of a man destroyed by his genius.<br></p><p>William Hjortsberg is the author of eight books, including <i>Alp</i>, <i>Gray Matters</i>, and <i>Falling Angel</i>, as well as the screenplays Legend&#x201d; and Thunder &amp; Lightning.&#x201d; He lives in Montana with his wife, painter Janie Camp.*Starred Review* It&#x2019;s not uncommon for a biography to begin with the subject&#x2019;s death, but Hjortsberg&#x2019;s account of Richard Brautigan&#x2019;s suicide, in 1984, at age 49, is jolting in its explicitness, a foretaste of the fervency of this all-embracing portrait of the author of such era-defining works as Trout Fishing in America (1967) and The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster (1968). Hjortsberg (Nevermore, 1994) knew Brautigan and spent 20 years conducting revelatory interviews and gathering the visceral details that make this an exceptionally intimate, vital, meticulous, and involving biography and anecdotal chronicle of the West Coast literary counterculture. Brautigan never knew his father and lived a life of &#x201c;grinding poverty&#x201d; in Washington and Oregon with his scrappy mother and various stepfathers, picking fruit, fishing, idolizing Hemingway, and writing. After surviving a breakdown, incarceration, and electroshock treatments, Brautigan hitchhiked to San Francisco in 1956 and began the hard labor of transforming himself from a shy and awkward &#x201c;country bumpkin&#x201d; into a cutting-edge writer and iconic eccentric. Hjortsberg delves incisively into Brautigan&#x2019;s volatile friendships and doomed marriages, struggles to get published, leeriness of fame, heavy drinking, and increasingly disturbing behavior, concluding that Brautigan, for all the wit and whimsy of his work, was forever haunted by the &#x201c;bleakness&#x201d; of his childhood. A prodigious work of scholarship, remembrance, and empathy. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>The Drinker</h2><p>Written in an encrypted notebook while incarcerated in a Nazi insane asylum and discovered after his death, <i>The Drinker </i>may be Hans Fallada&#x2019;s most breathtaking piece of craftsmanship. It is an intense yet absorbing study of the descent into drunkenness by an intelligent man who fears he&#x2019;s lost it all.<br><br>***<br><br>This is a&nbsp;<b>Hybrid Book</b>.<br><br>Melville House&nbsp;HybridBooks&nbsp;combine print and digital media into an enhanced reading experience by including with each title additional curated material called&nbsp;<b>Illuminations</b>&nbsp;&#x2014; maps, photographs, illustrations, and further writing about the author and the book. The Melville House Illuminations are free with the purchase of any title in the&nbsp;HybridBook series, no matter the format.</p><p>Before WWII , German writer Hans Fallada&#x2019;s novels were international bestsellers, on a par with those of his countrymen Thomas Mann and Herman Hesse. In America, Hollywood even turned his first big novel, <i>Little Man, What Now? </i>into a major motion picture.<br><br> Learning the movie was made by a Jewish producer, however, Hitler decreed Fallada&#x2019; s work could no longer be sold outside Germany, and the rising Nazis began to pay him closer attention. When he refused to join the Nazi party he was arrested by the Gestapo&#x2014;who eventually released him, but thereafter regularly summoned him for &#x201c;discussions&#x201d; of his work.<br><br> However, unlike Mann, Hesse, and others, Fallada refused to flee to safety, even when his British publisher, George Putnam, sent a private boat to rescue him. The pressure took its toll on Fallada, and he resorted increasingly to drugs and alcohol for relief. After Goebbels ordered him to write an anti-Semitic novel, he snapped and found himself imprisoned in an asylum for the &#x201c;criminally insane&#x201d;&#x2014;considered a death sentence under Nazi rule. To forestall the inevitable, he pretended to write the assignment for Goebbels, while actually composing three encrypted books&#x2014;including his tour de force novel <i>The Drinker</i>&#x2014;in such dense code that they were not deciphered until long after his death.<br><br> Fallada outlasted the Reich and was freed at war&#x2019;s end. But he was a shattered man. To help him recover by putting him to work, Fallada&#x2019;s publisher gave him the Gestapo file of a simple, working-class couple who had resisted the Nazis. Inspired, Fallada completed <i>Every Man Dies Alone </i>in just twenty-four days. <br><br> He died in February 1947, just weeks before the book&#x2019;s publication.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Arts in Spain: From Prehistory to Postmodernism (World of Art)</h2><p>From prehistory to postmodernism, the arts in Spain have occupied a central role in the development of Western art. In this wide-ranging and incisive overview, John F. Moffitt traces the history of painting, sculpture, the decorative arts and architecture. He investigates Iberian and Roman beginnings and examines the splendor of the Islamic and Christian foundations of Cordoba and the Escorial, before concentrating on the masterworks of El Greco, the Golden Age of Zurbaran and Velazquez, and the multi-faceted art of Goya. After discussing the brilliant innovations of Picasso, Dali and Miro, Professor Moffitt considers the most recent developments in Spanish art. Authoritative and ambitious in its chronological span, the book encompasses the enormous breadth of the Spanish artistic panorama, revealing that many of its most characteristic modern traits had their inception in earliest times.</p><p></p><h2>The Sword and the Scimitar</h2><p>From the cruelty of the slave markets of Algiers to the majesty of Topkapi, the sultan&#39;s seraglio in Istanbul, to the convent of the noble Knights of St. John in Malta, this is a novel of the timeless struggle between the religions and cultures of the east and west. Nico and Maria, Maltese brother and sister, are separated when young Nico is abducted by Moorish slavers. Taken to Algiers to be the personal slave of a wealthy merchant, he becomes a pawn in household politics and sets out to escape. Extraordinary events lead him to the court of Suleiman, the magnificent Sultan of the Ottomans. Maria, stranded in Malta with unsympathetic parents, makes her own plans to escape the island and find her brother. She joins a group of Jews - forced by their Christian rulers to renounce their faith - who continue their rituals clandestinely. French aristocrat Christien de Vries yearns to prove himself as a surgeon in the Order of St John, to which he was pledged as an infant but joined only as a result of a life-altering oath. These unforgettable characters find themselves caught up in the sweep of history as the Ottomans confront the Knights in the historic Siege of Malta, and the fate of Europe hangs in the balance.</p><p>David Ball lives in the Rockies with his wife, Melinda, and children, Ben and Li.

Despite a plethora of new translations in the second half of the twentieth century, the King James Version retains its power and appeal because "it has the intrinsic value of a classic and is an enduring masterpiece."<br><br>Drury outlines the fascinating history of this magisterial translation, marveling at the "patient generosity" with which the translators sifted through and distilled a century of previous scholarship. He points out that their work has endured not only because of the astonishing care they took to reflect faithfully the syntax of the original Hebrew and Greek&#x2013;which enabled them to dispense with the densely entangled prose style that characterized English writing at the time&#x2013;but also because of their concern to writers from Milton to Coleridge to George Eliot. From the doctrinal richness of the letters of St. Paul to those four masterpieces of storytelling, the Gospels, <i>The New Testament</i> has served as a source of inspiration for centuries.<br><br>To quote George Steiner on the centrality of the Bible: "What you have in hand is not a book. It is the book. That, of course, is what 'Bible' means. It is the book which, not only in Western humanity, defines the concept of a text. All our other books, however different in matter or method, relate, be it indirectly, to this book of books...All other books are inhabited by the murmur of that distant source."</p></p><p>This edition of the Old Testament in the King James Version, George Steiner reminds us of the literary grandeur, uniqueness, and centrality of the Bible.Gwyn Jones&nbsp;and&nbsp;Thomas Jones&nbsp;were, respectively, Professor of English at Aberystwyth and Cardiff and Professor of Welsh at Aberystwyth.

The first is a sharp analysis: through dialogues, parodies and essays, Burgess sheds new light on what he called &#39;an apocalyptic codex of our worst fears&#39;, creating a critique that is literature in its own right. Part two is Burgess&#39; own dystopic vision, written in 1978. He skewers both the present and the future, describing a state where industrial disputes and social unrest compete with overwhelming surveillance, security concerns and the dominance of technology to make life a thing to be suffered rather than lived. Together these two works form a unique guide to one of the twentieth century&#39;s most talented, imaginative and prescient writers. Several decades later, Burgess&#39; most singular work still stands.</p><p>Anthony Burgess (1917-1993) was a novelist, poet, playwright, composer, linguist, translator and critic. He is best known for his novel A Clockwork Orange, but altogether he wrote thirty-three novels, twenty-five works of non-fiction, two volumes of autobiography, three symphonies, more than 150 other musical works, reams of journalism and much more. He was born in Manchester, England and grew up in Harpurhey and Moss Side, went to school in Rusholme, and studied at Manchester University. He lived in Malaya, Malta, Monaco, Italy and the US amongst other places, and is still widely read all over the world.An exciting, bleakly fascinating story told with enormous erudition and wit. Its indignation is blazingly imaginative, furiously vital and gives us hope * Financial Times * The unclassifiable Mr Burgess has once more broken new ground -- Kingsley Amis * Observer * There is too much which is truly excellent for anyone to ignore it -- Auberon Waugh * Evening Standard * Burgess is the great postmodern storehouse of British writing - an important experimentalist; an encyclopaedic amasser, but also a maker of form; a playful comic, with a dark gloom -- Malcolm Bradbury One of the cleverest and most original writers of his generation * The Times * Wonderful ... I don&#39;t agree with everything Burgess writes, but the way he writes it is spectacular. It&#39;s hard to make profound ideas read so easily; Burgess does, with such artfulness that you almost forget how profound it is. It&#39;s a masterclass in everything from history and sociology to pop culture and sexuality, and breezes by like a cheery pop song. Burgess was also famed as a raconteur, and that might be the closest approximation of delight you feel reading him: you&#39;re in company with a brilliant mind who makes everything entertaining and comprehensible. * Irish Independent *</p><h2>The Land and the Book: An Introduction to the World of the Bible</h2><p>This volume guides readers through the world of the Bible, the land where the decisive religious experiences of the ancient Israelites and the earliest Christians took place. One cannot understand Judaism or Christianity without knowing not only the history and culture but also the geography of the biblical lands. Here the authors bring together the fruits of contemporary historical and archaeological research to introduce the writings, events, and, most important the land of the Bible. The Land and the Book provides an overview of the geography and the history of the Bible by the use of brief descriptions of each of the major areas in which the events of the biblical narrative took place ( primarily Palestine, Egypt, and Syria) and reviews of the history of ancient Israel, beginning with the patriachs and continuing through the New Testament era and the crusader period to the present. Extensive archaeological and historical descriptions set the stage for a more thorough understanding of the biblical drama by detailing the natural environment of a site; the human artifacts, buildings, and structures discovered there; and the manner in which all illuminate the biblical material * Includes charts and descriptions of archaeological periods, a chronological chart of biblical events, and a glossary of terms-- helps the reader better understand the world of the Bible.</p><p>This book provides an overview of the geography and the history of the Bible by the use of brief descriptions of each of the major areas in which the events of the biblical narrative took place and reviews of the history of ancient Israel, beginning with the patriarchs and continuing through the New Testament era and the crusader period to the present.Charles R.

Look no further. Florence King's celebrated field guide to the land below the Mason-Dixon Line is now blissfully back in print, just in time for the Clinton era. The Failed Souther Lady's classic primer on Dixie manners captures such storied types as the Southern Woman (frigid, passionate, sweet, bitchy, and scatterbrained--all at the same time), the Self-Rejuvenating Virgin, and the Good Ole Boy in all his coats and stripes. (The Clinton questions--<i>is he a G.O.B. or isn't he</i>?--Miss king covers in her hilarious new Afterword.) No one has ever made more sharp, scathing, affectionate, real sense out of the land of the endless Civil War than Florence King in these razor-edged pages.</p></p><p><p><b>Florence King</b> is the author of C<i>onfessions of a Failed Southern Lady, With Charity Toward None</i>, and other books. Though she still lives in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Washington-fed yuppies may yet drive her father into the hills.</p><b>SOUTHERN LADIES &amp; GENTLEMEN</b><br><i><b>1</b></i><i><b>"Build a Fence Around the South and You'd Have One Big Madhouse"</b></i><b><i>or: The Tip of the Iceberg</i></b>I have good reason to know that the only way to understand Southerners fully is to be one. When I was in graduate school at the University of Mississippi, I found myself party to a drunken kidnapping and ended up in a rowboat in the middle of a lake at 2:00 A.M. with an hysterical Southern belle who kept hissing: "Kill him, Wade, kill him!"Suddenly I wondered: How did I get into this? What am I doing here? How was it possible that a sane young woman like myself could merge so effortlessly into a situation that bizarre?The answer came to me just as suddenly. I was not sane, I was a Southerner. It is interesting to speculate on the moment when a child first realizes that he or she is a Southerner. No one ever actually tells him he is one, but something always occurs at a very tender age that helps fix it in his mind. The moment of truth tends to arrive in a burst of comprehension, following an incident in which an important truth suddenly becomes perfectly clear despite the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever. Once a child successfully negotiates this psychological legerdemain and snatches chaos from the jaws of logic, he wins his crossed cavalry sabers.My red-letter moment occurred in the Year Eight of Franklin D. Roosevelt as I stood in front of the candy counter at Woolworth's. The sign on the counter read: TAR BABIES 20� LB. Inside the bin was amountain of little licorice candies shaped like black children. Everyone privately called them "nigger babies," but my grandmother had taught me that using the word "nigger" was one of those things no lady could do and still remain a lady. Granny wouldn't even say "tar." And so, to avoid hurting the feelings of the blacks who were standing up at the end of the segregated lunch counter where she was seated, she swiveled around on her stool and called out to me:"Do you want some babies to eat in the movies?"As the blacks looked up and stared at her, everything fell into place. Granny was an arch-segregationist with perfect manners; it's all right to segregate people as long as you don't hurt their feelings. Furthermore it is much better to be known as a white cannibal than as white trash who uses words like "nigger," because to a Southerner it is faux pas, not sins, that matter in this world.I bought a nickel bag of tar babies, and Granny and I went off to the movies. The film was H. Rider Haggard's <i>She</i>, which I assumed would be a newsreel about Mrs. Roosevelt. (I had grown up hearing: "It's not his fault, <i>she</i> made him do it. <i>She</i> got them all stirred up, <i>she</i> thinks they're just as good as <i>she</i> is.") I sat through the film waiting for the First Lady to appear. Finally, when the withered old woman died in the snows of Tibet, I asked Granny: "Is that Mrs. Roosevelt?"She snorted and said: "Would that it were."For the second time that day, I heard the click of regional identity in my brain. Now I understood how it was possible for my family to worship FDR despite all the things he had done during his administrations that enraged them. They had used Southern logic to "straighten everything out just fine." It was very simple: Credit Franklin, better known as He, for all the things you like, and blame Eleanor, better known as She or "that woman," for all the things you don't like. This way, He was cleared, She was castigated, and We were happy.Once my regionalism was launched, there was no stopping the stockpile of Southern contradiction that built up in my mind. As we emerged from the movie, Granny was busy making a grocery list and did not notice that I was still eating tar babies. But suddenly she turned, looked down, and gave me the Southern woman's all-powerful silent reproach known as "freezing." This is a look that needs no words. It is an exercise in pained hauteur and courageous endurance topped off with flaring nostrils and a stiffening just this side of rigor mortis. Despitemy tender age, I knew instantly what it meant without being told: Ladies don't eat on the street. Granny did not have to tell me why, because my burgeoning Southern instincts told me: It looked <i>trashy.</i>I already knew that ladies did not smoke on the street. My mother, who smoked five packs of Lucky Strike Greens a day, was always announcing an oncoming nicotine fit with a fluttery moan, an unfinished gesture toward her handbag, and her favorite dire pronouncement: "If I don't have a cigarette, I'm goin' to fall down dead." Yet as much as she loved tobacco, I had never seen her smoke on the street. I had seen her shake on the street and I had heard her become incoherent on the street, but she had never smoked alfresco because it looked trashy.No one ever told me what "trashy" meant, but I never asked because I can't remember ever <i>not</i> knowing. As any Southerner can verify, the definition of trashy is trashy.Granny and I went to the Fourteenth Street arcade market after the show. It took us nearly an hour to make our way down the sawdust-covered main aisle--Granny had to stop and "pass the time of day" with everyone she knew, which was just about everyone in the market. She sailed in, a two-hundred-pound neighborhood chatelaine in a lace bertha, bifocals, and a ten-year-old Empress Eug�nie hat tilted at a rakish angle.Instantly, the air was thick with her Tidewater Virginia drawl and those view halloos worthy of John Peel that she emitted every time she saw a friend. Traffic in the aisle was soon backed up to the Bundles for Britain booth beside the front door, but Granny talked on, the spotted veil on her hat fluttering like an ensign in a high wind."Oh, look, there's Miz Whitmore! OOO-HOO! Miz Whitmore! You come right over here this very minute! I haven't seen you since the fall of Rome!"She meant two Saturdays ago, but I suddenly understood the principle behind the Southern internal time clock. Granny, a genealogy buff, was sunk like a Wasp dinosaur in the muck of prehistory, in love with any bygone age she could lay her hands on.Another regional click: What is past is perfect.After Granny had finished making her gracious way down the aisle, we bought a "mess" of pickled pigs' feet, a "mess" of oysters in the shell, and a "mess" of Maryland soft-shell crabs. Then, laden downwith enough unfit edibles to make us stagger, we stopped by the kosher deli for a "mess" of bagels, which Granny persisted in calling doughnuts."How do, Mr. Silverman! How in the world are you? Law, I haven't seen you since the Age of Pericles!""But you were here day before yesterday, Mrs. Ruding," Mr. Silverman pointed out. I looked at him strangely, realizing for the first time that he never picked up on Granny's figures of speech."Let me have a mess of your wonderful doughnuts, please, sir."Again, he looked puzzled."How many?""Twelve," said Granny.It was not the first time I had heard these two confuse each other, but now I gave some hard thought to their communication problem. How could anyone not know what a "mess" was? <i>Everybody</i> knew that it meant a dozen or a pound, unless, of course, it meant a bushel or a peck, or, in the country, a truckload. My maturing Southern mind conceived a clear, concise picture of a "mess." It was a neatly arranged and properly weighed collection of anything edible. If it was more than the usual unspecified amount, it was a "nice mess."It was to be many years before I realized how Mr. Silverman must have felt. Day after day, he had to stand in his hospital-clean store and listen to Southerners order a mess of his beautiful, ritually slaughtered, and rabbinically approved foods.&nbsp;<br>It has been said that when two Greeks meet they will start a restaurant, two Germans will start an army, and two Englishmen will start a silence. It is not necessary for two Southerners to meet in order to start something because we have taken a little nervous problem called schizophrenia and raised it to the level of a high art. When one-half of a Southerner meets the other half, the result is folie � deux.It is this simple fact that Yankees always miss.The best-known Yankee who missed it was that nineteenth-century traveler, Frederick Law Olmstead. Judging from his journals, his mind was blown soon after he set foot across the Mason-Dixon line.A much more recent casualty was one Dr. Jonathan Latham of Boston, who wanted to win the Pulitzer prize in regional studies.It all began on a Southbound plane, in which Dr. Latham was contentedly sipping a Scotch-on-the-rocks as he planned his scholarly attack on bourbon country. He was headed for a small city in Dixie, armed with an attach� case filled with three-by-five cards, which no Yankee sociologist can live without, and a heavily underlined copy of <i>The Mind of the South,</i> by Wilbur J. Cash, which no Yankee sociologist can live with--because, after all, Cash was himself a Southerner and therefore incapable of cool objectivity, that quality which alone can solve the mystery of Southern psychology.Dr. Latham, a wholehearted believer in the infallibility of the scientific method, was firmly convinced that his frequency charts and cluster-grouping graphs would triumph over the Southern penchant for irrational behavior and contradictory thought processes. He knew his forthcoming book about the South would be a brilliant success because he intended, with the aid of the objectivity for which he was deservedly famous, to drive the spike of logic through the opaque mist of contradiction and paradox that floats like a vapor over every Southerner's head.Warmed by this pleasant thought, Latham took out his copy of <i>Gone with the Wind</i> ...</p><h2>Gather at the River: Twenty-Five Authors on Fishing</h2><p><p>From editors David Joy and Eric Rickstad comes&nbsp;<em>Gather at the River</em>, an anthology of twenty-five remarkable essays on fishing from an ensemble of contemporary authors.

Following the arc of his remarkable life&#x2019;s journey through his more than eighteen-year tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to the present, in the second half of <i>The Age of Turbulence</i> Dr. Greenspan embarks on a magnificent tour d&#x2019;horizon of the global economy. The distillation of a life&#x2019;s worth of wisdom and insight into an elegant expression of a coherent worldview, <i>The Age of Turbulence</i> will stand as Alan Greenspan&#x2019;s personal and intellectual legacy.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, in his fourteenth year as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan took part in a very quiet collective effort to ensure that America didn't experience an economic meltdown, taking the rest of the world with it. There was good reason to fear the worst: the stock market crash of October 1987, his first major crisis as Federal Reserve Chairman, coming just weeks after he assumed control, had come much closer than is even today generally known to freezing the financial system and triggering a genuine financial panic. But the most remarkable thing that happened to the economy after 9/11 was...nothing. What in an earlier day would have meant a crippling shock to the system was absorbed astonishingly quickly. <p> After 9/11 Alan Greenspan knew, if he needed any further reinforcement, that we're living in a new world - the world of a global capitalist economy that is vastly more flexible, resilient, open, self-directing, and fast-changing than it was even 20 years ago. It's a world that presents us with enormous new possibilities but also enormous new challenges. <i>The Age of Turbulence</i> is Alan Greenspan's incomparable reckoning with the nature of this new world - how we got here, what we're living through, and what lies over the horizon, for good and for ill-channeled through his own experiences working in the command room of the global economy for longer and with greater effect than any other single living figure. He begins his account on that September 11th morning, but then leaps back to his childhood, and follows the arc of his remarkable life's journey through to his more than 18-year tenure as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, from 1987 to 2006, during a time of transforming change. </p><p> Alan Greenspan shares the story of his life first simply with an eye toward doing justice to the extraordinary amount of history he has experienced and shaped. But his other goal is to draw readers along the same learning curve he followed, so they accrue a grasp of his own understanding of the underlying dynamics that drive world events. In the second half of the book, having brought us to the present and armed us with the conceptual tools to follow him forward, Dr. Greenspan embarks on a magnificent tour de horizon of the global economy. He reveals the universals of economic growth, delves into the specific facts on the ground in each of the major countries and regions of the world, and explains what the trend-lines of globalization are from here. The distillation of a life's worth of wisdom and insight into an elegant expression of a coherent worldview, <i>The Age of Turbulence</i> will stand as Alan Greenspan's personal and intellectual legacy. </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td><strong>A Timeline of a Remarkable Career</strong></td></tr> <tr> <td>Mar. 6, 1926</td> <td></td> <td>Born in New York City</td></tr> <tr> <td>1936</td> <td></td> <td> At 10 sees Roosevelt campaigning; becomes expert on the 1936 Yankees</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1938</td> <td></td> <td>Takes up clarinet at 12</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1943-44</td> <td></td> <td>Studies clarinet at Julliard</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mid 1944</td> <td></td> <td>Joins Henry Jerome Band</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1948</td> <td></td> <td>Graduates (summa cum laude) from New York University.

Based on Scripture, the Fathers, St. Thomas. An acknowledged classic which goes to the heart of our religion.</p><p>Originally published in 1884, this translation of the 17th-century work Treatise on the Love of God is a challenging, complex text discussing the inclinations of the soul, especially toward a love of the divine. Saint Francis de Sales explains to dedicated readers how every aspect of human life has as its goal the cultivation of this divine affection--the author devotes great effort upon and exploration of this single emotion. <p> Devout Christians and spiritual seekers who delve into this book will be rewarded by the great insights the saint has to offer.</p>St. Francis de Sales was born in 1567 to Francois and Francoise de Boisy in what is currently Haute-Savoie, France. His father sent him to a good school when he was young, and he received spiritual formation from the Jesuits. After a disturbing spiritual fear of being condemned, he eventually resolved his problem and decided to dedicate his life to God in 1587. He became a doctor of law at the age of 24 at the Jesuit College of Clermont, Paris, and was ordained a priest by Bishop Claude de Granier and stationed in Geneva in 1593. He became bishop of Geneva in 1602. <br><br> Francis de Sales is the author of various collections of sermons on Mary, Lent, prayer and Christmastide, as well as a work entitled <i>Set Your Heart Free</i>, edited by John Kirvan. He was known as a spiritually understanding man as well as a friend of the poor. Though known for his great intellect and theological wisdom, he spoke with simplicity and earnestness, so that all could understand. <i> An Introduction to the Devout Life </i>, his best-loved work, is based on notes he wrote for a cousin for marriage, stressing that sanctity is possible in everyday life. He died in 1622 on December 28, and was canonized by Pope Alexander VII in 1665. His feast is celebrated on January 24.<br></p><h2>The SeaQuel: My Big Fat Zombie Goldfish (My Big Fat Zombie Goldfish, 2)</h2><p><p>After Tom rescued Frankie the goldfish from his big brother Mark's toxic science experiment by zapping him back to life with a battery, Frankie somehow became a <b>BIG FAT ZOMBIE GOLDFISH</b> with dangerous hypnotic powers.

And every time Dad screeched round another bend, Pradeep turned a deeper shade of green. We were on our way to the vacation place that Dad had booked. Usually only Dad, my Evil Scientist big brother Mark, Pradeep&#x2019;s dad and his evil computer-genius big brother Sanj went on the Big Summer Weekend. But this year Sanj was at computer camp, and for the first time Dad said me and Pradeep were old enough to come. Nothing was going to wreck this weekend! <br>Not Pradeep, who was just about to hurl for the fifth time in four hours (I could tell because he had that surprised look on his face again). Not Sami, Pradeep&#x2019;s three-year-old sister, who had to come with us because as soon as our moms heard Pradeep and I were going away too, they booked themselves on a Massage and Mud Pack weekend. (Which I didn&#x2019;t understand at all. Moms hate mud on your shoes. They <i>really</i> hate mud on the living room carpet. But apparently they love it on their faces. Who knew?) This weekend wouldn&#x2019;t even be ruined by Mark not saying a word to me since he found out that Pradeep, Sami, and I were coming. If only he wouldn&#x2019;t thump me too, then it would be perfect. <br>&#x201c;Bag,&#x201d; Pradeep mumbled as we went over a bump in the road. <br>&#x201c;Bag,&#x201d; I said to Sami as she bounced in her car seat next to me. She passed me one of the stack of airplane sick bags that Pradeep&#x2019;s mom had packed for him for the journey. I unfolded it and passed it to Pradeep. Pradeep&#x2019;s mom gets these super-strong sick bags off the Internet because they can hold loads without breaking. They make the best splat bombs ever &#x2019;cause they never burst until they hit their target. It seemed a shame to waste them on actual car sickness. But a kid&#x2019;s gotta do what a kid&#x2019;s gotta do. <br>&#x201c;Bleeech!&#x201d; Pradeep filled the sick bag and then stared out the window. <br>&#x201c;Are we there yet? Are we there yet?&#x201d; Sami sang from her seat. <br>Dad looked straight ahead at the winding road. &#x201c;About twenty minutes maybe,&#x201d; he said. <br>Pradeep&#x2019;s dad was looking at his smartphone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s 13.2 miles exactly to the destination.&#x201d; Pradeep&#x2019;s dad could get a job as one of those GPS things in cars. He&#x2019;s got the perfect voice for it. You would totally believe that he knew where he was going, even if he didn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t think he would fit on the dashboard though. <br>&#x201c;If you look toward the sea, you can see the lighthouse from here,&#x201d; Dad said. <br>Pradeep, Sami, and I all craned our necks to look. The lighthouse was tall and white like a swirly whipped vanilla ice-cream cone sticking up out of the sea. That is, if swirly whipped vanilla ice-cream cones had giant lights at the top of them. It jutted out into the bay so the water lapped against it. <br>Mark sat slumped in the back of the car behind us, flicking through <i>Evil Scientist </i>magazine. This month&#x2019;s cover feature was called &#x201c;How to Take Over the World in Ten Easy Steps.&#x201d; He had his earbuds in and didn&#x2019;t even look up when Dad spoke. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s awesome, Mark. An actual lighthouse,&#x201d; I said to him. <br>Mark shot me an evil glare. &#x201c;There is nothing awesome about this moron-fest vacation.&#x201d; He pulled his hood up over his head. &#x201c;You losers have made this the lamest trip ever.&#x201d; <br>The cooler that was under Sami&#x2019;s feet started shaking. I lifted the lid to investigate. The eyes of Frankie, my zombie goldfish, glowed green as he batted cans of Coke against the sides of the cooler with his fins. He must have heard Mark&#x2019;s voice and gone all zombie mega-thrash fish. He still held a grudge against my brother for trying to murder him with his Evil Scientist toxic gunk. Luckily, Pradeep and I shocked Frankie back to life with a battery, and ever since, he&#x2019;s been our friend and fishy bodyguard. I hoped Frankie would calm down soon. <br>&#x201c;Swishy fish!&#x201d; Sami shouted. <br>I put my finger to my lips and turned to Sami. &#x201c;Shhhhhh!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What was that, precious?&#x201d; asked Pradeep&#x2019;s dad. <br>&#x201c;Uh, I think she&#x2019;s just excited about seeing fish in the sea,&#x201d; I said, covering for her. <br>Sami giggled and I carefully closed the lid of the cooler. Safe for now. <br>As Pradeep and I looked out the window, we saw a thick layer of fog hanging over the lighthouse, wrapping itself around a barely visible sign. I squinted to read it. WELCOME TO EEL BAY, it said in big letters, and then in smaller print that looked like it was painted on just yesterday, DON&#x2019;T FEED THE EELS!

Dorothy had a unique ability to make complex bridge concepts simple to understand, and everything here, from the basics to the most complicated squeeze or endplay, is described in an interesting and easy-to-follow way. In addition to the technical material, the reader will also learn when and how to use deceptive tactics to give the opponents a chance to make mistakes. Each chapter has many sample hands to test and challenge the reader. Dorothy Hayden Truscott (1925-2006) was the top-ranked woman bridge player for many years. She won four World titles and twenty-eight National titles including the Life Master Pairs and the Blue Ribbon Pairs. She also came in second in the Bermuda Bowl and placed third in the World Open Pairs, the highest finish ever by a woman. Dorothy was a World Bridge Federation Grand Master, and was elected to the Bridge Hall of Fame in 1998. She is the author of the classic bridge book Bid Better, Play Better, and she co-authored several books with her husband Alan Truscott. Among her contributions to bridge theory are splinter bids and DOPI.</p><p></p><h2>Mixed Effects Models and Extensions in Ecology with R (Statistics for Biology and Health)</h2><p>This book discusses advanced statistical methods that can be used to analyse ecological data. Most environmental collected data are measured repeatedly over time, or space and this requires the use of GLMM or GAMM methods. The book starts by revising regression, additive modelling, GAM and GLM, and then discusses dealing with spatial or temporal dependencies and nested data.</p><p><p>Building on the successful <em>Analysing Ecological Data</em> (2007) by Zuur, Ieno and Smith, the authors now provide an expanded introduction to using regression and its extensions in analysing ecological data. As with the earlier book, real data sets from postgraduate ecological studies or research projects are used throughout. The first part of the book is a largely non-mathematical introduction to linear mixed effects modelling, GLM and GAM, zero inflated models, GEE, GLMM and GAMM. The second part provides ten case studies that range from koalas to deep sea research. These chapters provide an invaluable insight into analysing complex ecological datasets, including comparisons of different approaches to the same problem. By matching ecological questions and data structure to a case study, these chapters provide an excellent starting point to analysing your own data. Data and R code from all chapters are available from www.highstat.com.</p> <p>Alain F. Zuur is senior statistician and director of Highland Statistics Ltd., a statistical consultancy company based in the UK. He has taught statistics to more than 5000 ecologists.

This metaphor is depicted by the cover of this book ... . full of excellent example code and for most graphs and analyses the code is printed and explained in detail. ... Each example finishes with ... valuable information for a person new to a technique. In summary, I highly recommend the book to anyone who is familiar with basic statistics ... who wants to expand his/her statistical knowledge to analyse ecological data." (Bernd Gruber, <i>Basic and Applied Ecology</i>, Vol. 10, 2009)</p><p>"This book is written in a very approachable conversational style. The additional focus on the heuristics of the process rather than just a rote recital of theory and equations is commendable. This type of approach helps the reader get behind the &#x2018;why&#x2019; of what&#x2019;s being done rather than blindly follow a simple list of rules.... In short, this text is good for researchers with at least a little familiarity with the basic concepts of modeling and who want some solid stop-by-stop guidance with examples on how common ecological modeling tasks are accomplished using R." (Aaron Christ, <i>Journal of Statistical Software</i>, November 2009, Vol. 32)</p><p>"The authors succeed in explaining complex extensions of regression in largely nonmathematical terms and clearly present appropriate R code for each analysis. A major strength of the text is that instead of relying on idealized datasets ... the authors use data from consulting projects or dissertation research to expose issues associated with &#x2018;real&#x2019; data. ... The book is well written and accessible ... . the volume should be a useful reference for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and experienced professionals working in the biological sciences." (Paul E. Bourdeau, The Quarterly Review of Biology, Vol. 84, December, 2009)</p><p>&#x201c;This is a companion volume to Analyzing Ecology Data by the same authors. ...It extends the previous work by looking at more complex general and generalized linear models involving mixed effects or heterogeneity in variances. It is aimed at statistically sophisticated readers who have a good understanding of multiple regression models... .The pedagogical style is informal... . The authors are pragmatists&#x2015;they use combinations of informal graphical approaches, formal hypothesis&nbsp; testing, and information-theoretical model selection methods&nbsp; when analyzing data. ...Advanced graduate students in ecology or ecologists with several years of experience with &#x2018;messy&#x2019; data would find this book useful. ...Statisticians would find this book interesting for the nice explorations of many of the issues with messy data. This book would be (very) suitable for a graduate course on statistical consulting&#x2015;indeed, students would learn a great deal about the use of sophisticated statistical models in ecology! ...I very much liked this book (and also the previous volume). I enjoyed the nontechnical presentations of the complex ideas and their emphasis that a good analysis uses &#x2018;simple statistical methods wherever possible, but doesn&#x2019;t use them simplistically.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Biometrics, Summer 2009, 65, 992&#x2013;993)</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a great introduction to a wide variety of regression models. ... This text examines how to fit many alternative models using the statistical package R. ... The text is a valuable reference ... . A large number of real datasets are used as examples. Discussion on which model to use and the large number of recent references make the book useful for self study ... .&#x201d; (David J.

This new volume can only enhance Danker's renown in the academic world. Greek professors and students will be grateful for this volume, which incorporates all the features of a lexicon in a succinct handbook. Its size makes it appropriate for daily classroom use. The preface provides a splendid overview of the new directions Danker takes with this lexicon. Rather than presenting brief glosses for headwords, as other Greek New Testament lexica do, this volume provides extended definitions in idiomatic English for many Greek terms. Danker encourages users to formulate alternative renderings while keeping the extended definition as the governing agent. Irregular verb forms listed in bold type as headwords are especially useful for students. Entries include the headword, brief etymological data, extended definitions, short renderings, usage in specific passages, and an abundance of scriptural references. Organization of the data gives users easy access to rich resources. Skilled design in the page layout has resulted in an attractive, aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly volume. This lexicon will take its place alongside other standard Greek reference works. . . .

The South had formidable proslavery intellectuals who participated fully in transatlantic debates and boldly challenged an ascendant capitalist (&#34;free-labor&#34;) society. Blending classical and Christian traditions, they forged a moral and political philosophy designed to sustain conservative principles in history, political economy, social theory, and theology, while translating them into political action.</p><p>The Mind of the Master Class tells of America&#39;s greatest historical tragedy. A great many of the slaveholding men and women were intelligent, honorable, and pious; yet, these very people, admirable in so many ways, presided over a social system that proved itself an enormity and inflicted horrors on their slaves. Even now, there is much to be learned from their moral and political reflections on their times--and ours.Elizabeth Fox-Genovese is El�onore Raoul Professor of the Humanities at Emory University, where she was founding director of Women's Studies.

Realizing that his life is devoid of meaning, he grows determined to transcend his trivial existence and search for greater purpose. Raising thought-provoking questions while yielding hilarious consequences, and just as relevant today as ever, Babbitt&#x2019;s quest for meaning forces us to confront the Babbitt in ourselves&#x2014;and ponder what it truly means to be an American.</p><p>Following the critical and commercial success of Main Street, Sinclair Lewis directed his barbs at the American businessman in <i>Babbitt.</i> The central character, George Follansbee Babbitt, is a middle-aged realtor living in Zenith, the Zip City.

But what exactly is progressivism? What role has it played in the political, social, and economic history of America? <br><br>This very timely Very Short Introduction offers an engaging overview of progressivism in America--its origins, guiding principles, major leaders and major accomplishments. A many-sided reform movement that lasted from the late 1890s until the early 1920s, progressivism emerged as a response to the excesses of the Gilded Age, an era that plunged working Americans into poverty while a new class of ostentatious millionaires built huge mansions and flaunted their wealth. As capitalism ran unchecked and more and more economic power was concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, a sense of social crisis was pervasive. Progressive national leaders like William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette, and Woodrow Wilson, as well as muckraking journalists like Lincoln Steffens and Ida Tarbell, and social workers like Jane Addams and Lillian Wald answered the growing call for change. They fought for worker's compensation, child labor laws, minimum wage and maximum hours legislation; they enacted anti-trust laws, improved living conditions in urban slums, instituted the graduated income tax, won women the right to vote, and laid the groundwork for Roosevelt's New Deal. Nugent shows that the progressives--with the glaring exception of race relations--shared a common conviction that society should be fair to <em>all</em> its members and that governments had a responsibility to see that fairness prevailed. <br><br>Offering a succinct history of the broad reform movement that upset a stagnant conservative orthodoxy, this Very Short Introduction reveals many parallels, even lessons, highly appropriate to our own time.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

This short introduction to the field, written by leading historians of migration for student readers, offers an acute analysis of key issues across several disciplines. It takes in its scope an overview of migrations through history, how classic theories have interpreted such movements, and contemporary topics and debates including transnational and transcultural lives, access to citizenship, and migrant entrepreneurship. <br> <p>Historical perspectives reveal how the scholarly field emerged and developed over time and across cultures and how historians of migration have recently begun to re-write the story of human life on earth. Throughout, the authors suggest how the movements of millions of mobile men and women persistently challenge changing scholarly paradigms for understanding their lives. Key concepts and theories, such as systems, networks, and gender, are explained and historicized to produce a complex picture of the interaction of migrants, scholars, and disciplinary cultures in a globalized world.</p></p><p>Christiane Harzig is an Associate Professor at Arizona State University. <p>Dirk Hoerder is a Professor at Arizona State University.</p>"Up-to-date and intelligent, it covers an enormous span, both chronologically and conceptually, from the ancient world to the modern; from Asia to Europe and the Americas; from historiography to system theory and intercultural relations." <br> <b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b> <p>"A very helpful tool for both learning about migration history and migration research."<br> <i><b>European History Quarterly</b></i></p> <p><b><i> </i></b>"This book provides the reader with an updated, and mostly complete, summary of migration history while remaining a short read. Beyond making a great reading assignment for an undergraduate class, this book truly manages to challenge and engage its readership into rethinking its notions of migration out of the classic American area."<br> <i><b>Canadian Journal of History</b></i></p> <p>"The book's great strength is in addressing a great number of historical and contemporary topics in migration as well as numerous analytical perspectives."<br> <i><b>Journal of World History</b></i></p> <p>"Comprehensive and lively, this volume spans the history and scholarship on migtration, telling a gendered tale that attends to structure, agency and migration sysstems.

It should become an essential text book for courses dealing with global migration."<br> <b>Colin Pooley, Lancaster University</b></p> <p>"This is a short book with a long temporal span and a big conceptual framework. It treats migration not as a chapter of U.S. history, or any other national narrative, but as a central and intrinsic element of the human condition. Its historical coverage stretches from the first homo sapiens exodus out of our East-African cradle to the present. The authors offer a thoughtful discussion of migration and cultural-interaction theories. They not only stress the variety of migration experiences but also detect recurrent patterns in what at first sight may seem endless diversity and build explanatory typologies based on their findings."<br> <b>Jose C. Moya, Director, Forum on Migration, Barnard College, Columbia University</b></p></p><h2>Rogues: Two Essays on Reason (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)</h2><p><i>Rogues</i>, published in France under the title <i>Voyous</i>, comprises two major lectures that Derrida delivered in 2002 investigating the foundations of the sovereignty of the nation-state. The term "<i>�tat voyou</i>" is the French equivalent of "rogue state," and it is this outlaw designation of certain countries by the leading global powers that Derrida rigorously and exhaustively examines. Derrida examines the history of the concept of sovereignty, engaging with the work of Bodin, Hobbes, Rousseau, Schmitt, and others. Against this background, he delineates his understanding of "democracy to come," which he distinguishes clearly from any kind of regulating ideal or teleological horizon. The idea that democracy will always remain in the future is not a temporal notion. Rather, the phrase would name the coming of the unforeseeable other, the structure of an event beyond calculation and program. Derrida thus aligns this understanding of democracy with the logic he has worked out elsewhere. But it is not just political philosophy that is brought under deconstructive scrutiny here: Derrida provides unflinching and hard-hitting assessments of current political realities, and these essays are highly engaged with events of the post-9/11 world.</p><p>"Rogues is Derrida's most sustained reflection on deconstruction's relation to political theory in general and to the idea of democracy in particular. . . . Highly recommended."&#x2014;CHOICE<br><br>&#x201c;It is clear that Derrida was keen that the idea of &#x2018;democracy to come&#x2019; would be central to the legacy of his thought, and for those who choose to take up that burden, Rogues will prove essential.&#x201d;&#x2014;Times Literary SupplementThe late Jacques Derrida was Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and Professor of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine.

In line with the most recent scholarship, the authors do a very effective job of portraying the enslaved as actors, rather than simply as passive victims, without minimizing the importance of their allies in the struggle against slavery. The authors also do a very effective job of discussing the intricate connections between slavery and the evolution of racial attitudes. ... This is a serious work of scholarship that is clearly written."--Steven Mintz, University of Houston <br>"The authors do a first-rate job in carrying out [their] ambitious agenda. In almost every case, they have selected the essential legal documents regarding the establishment of, challenges to, and eventual destruction of Atlantic slavery. Their editing and interpretation of the documents is exemplary, reflecting a firm grasp of the complexities of the subject, and a thorough knowledge of an extensive historical literature. What ismore, their authorial style and pace should be inviting to student readers. ...

They learn to become committed citizens of this global community; about the events, people, communications, advancements and conflicts of the past and their consequences on the present; and how to find their own place in history. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Integrating Literacy and Social Studies</b> </p> <ul> <li>Information about teaching history, economy, geography, and the social sciences ensures students&#x2019; understanding of the content as well as their development of literacy skills.</li> <li> <b>Book Links</b> provide specific guidance for linking social studies content to motivating, enriching literature.</li> <li> <b>History&#x2019;s Finer Points</b> features engage you in historical thinking that will enliven your teaching.</li> </ul> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <i>This text is the best I have ever seen in the Social Studies field for content and strategies on how to develop a good literacy program for the Social Studies.&nbsp; Steven Thorpe, Southern </i> <i>Oregon</i> <i>University</i> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <b>Addressing the Realities of Today&#x2019;s Classroom</b> </p> <ul> <li> <b>Vignettes</b> in every chapter reflect masterful, integrated teaching found in the real classrooms of committed, successful social studies teachers.</li> <li>Special attention is paid to assessment and Standards alignment when preparing strategies for teaching social studies content and literacy integration.</li> </ul> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <i>The text clearly makes connections between social studies and the real world.&nbsp; It develops topics that are often barely mentioned, such as connections to real-world learning and combining reading and social studies.&nbsp; It focuses on the essential topics and develops them well.&nbsp; I think a student reading this book would come away with a good idea of how to teach social studies.&nbsp; Carolyn F. </i> <i>Riley</i> <i>, Northern </i> <i>Illinois</i> <i>University</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Providing Tools for the Classroom</b> </p> <ul> <li> <b>Field tested strategies</b> throughout chapters give you the resources to begin powerful, integrated social studies teaching immediately.</li> <li> <b>Lesson planning tools</b> help you design responsive instruction.</li> </ul> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p> <i>The specific literacy strategies are excellent.

Where and why did groups such as law and medicine achieve their power? Will professionalism spread throughout the occupational world? While most inquiries in this field study one profession at a time, Abbott here considers the system of professions as a whole. Through comparative and historical study of the professions in nineteenth- and twentieth-century England, France, and America, Abbott builds a general theory of how and why professionals evolve.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Abbott</b> is the Ralph Lewis Professor and Chairman of the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago.<br></p><h2>Twenty-One Genres and How to Write Them</h2><p>In this classroom-tested approach to writing, Brock Dethier teaches readers how to analyze and write twenty-one genres that students are likely to encounter in college and beyond. This practical, student-friendly, task-oriented text confidently guides writers through step-by-step processes, reducing the anxiety commonly associated with writing tasks. <p><br> In the first section, Dethier efficiently presents each genre, providing models; a description of the genres&#x2019; purpose, context, and discourse; and suggestions for writing activities or &#x201c;moves&#x201d; that writers can use to get words on the page and accomplish their writing tasks. The second section explains these moves, over two hundred of them, in chapters ranging from &#x201c;Solve Your Process Problems&#x201d; and &#x201c;Discover&#x201d; to &#x201c;Revise&#x201d; and &#x201c;Present.&#x201d; Applicable to any writing task or genre, these moves help students overcome writing blocks and develop a piece of writing from the first glimmers of an idea to its presentation. <br> <br> This approach to managing the complexity and challenge of writing in college strives to be useful, flexible, eclectic, and brief&#x2014;a valuable resource for students learning to negotiate unfamiliar writing situations.</p></p><p><b>Brock Dethier</b> is professor of English at Utah State University, where he directs the composition program and teaches writing and pedagogy at several levels.

The claim in this book is that first-hand research experiences with families allow one to document this competence and knowledge, and that such engagement provides many possibilities for positive pedagogical actions. <br><br>Drawing from both Vygotskian and neo-sociocultural perspectives in designing a methodology that views the everyday practices of language and action as constructing knowledge, the funds of knowledge approach facilitates a systematic and powerful way to represent communities in terms of the resources they possess and how to harness them for classroom teaching. <br><br>This book accomplishes three objectives: It gives readers the basic methodology and techniques followed in the contributors' funds of knowledge research; it extends the boundaries of what these researchers have done; and it explores the applications to classroom practice that can result from teachers knowing the communities in which they work. <br><br>In a time when national educational discourses focus on system reform and wholesale replicability across school sites, this book offers a counter-perspective stating that instruction must be linked to students' lives, and that details of effective pedagogy should be linked to local histories and community contexts. This approach should not be confused with parent participation programs, although that is often a fortuitous consequence of the work described. It is also not an attempt to teach parents "how to do school" although that could certainly be an outcome if the parents so desired. Instead, the funds of knowledge approach attempts to accomplish something that may be even more challenging: to alter the perceptions of working-class or poor communities by viewing their households primarily in terms of their strengths and resources, their defining pedagogical characteristics. <br><br><i>Funds of Knowledge: Theorizing Practices in Households, Communities, and Classrooms</i> is a critically important volume for all teachers and teachers-to-be, and for researchers and graduate students of language, culture, and education.</p><p><p><i>This volume is particularly useful for teachers who are re-thinking ways to design and create curriculum that reflects the experiences and knowledge of their multilingual and multicultural students....The importance of allowing students to make explicit connections between at-home and in-school practices is made relevant through the theory research, and classroom applications in this book.</i><br>&#x2014;<b><i>Language Arts</i></b></p><p><i>One of the most important concepts in culture-and-education is now laid out for us to know, in detail--its origin, argument, and human context. We should all be grateful.</i><br>&#x2014;<b>Roland Tharp</b><br><i>University of California, Berkeley</i></p><p><i>This is a very important book in its scope....[and] is very much needed....Longitudinal, field based research is still relatively uncommon, especially in teacher education, but it is the only way to document how culture is deeply embedded in children's and families' lives, and how teachers can use the knowledge held within communities to make a difference in reaching out to children and families who will soon constitute the new 'mainstream' in our schools.</i><br>&#x2014;<b>Catherine Emihovich</b><br><i>University of Florida</i></p></p><h2>The Great Thirst: Californians and Water-A History, Revised Edition</h2><p>The story of "the great thirst" is brought up to date in this revised edition of Norris Hundley's outstanding history, with additional photographs and incisive descriptions of the major water-policy issues facing California now: accelerating urbanization of farmland and open spaces, persisting despoliation of water supplies, and demands for equity in water allocation for an exploding population. People the world over confront these problems, and Hundley examines them with clarity and eloquence in the unruly laboratory of California.<br><br>The obsession with water has shaped California to a remarkable extent, literally as well as politically and culturally. Hundley tells how aboriginal Americans and then early Spanish and Mexican immigrants contrived to use and share the available water and how American settlers, arriving in ever-increasing numbers after the Gold Rush, transformed California into the home of the nation's preeminent water seekers. The desire to use, profit from, manipulate, and control water drives the people and events in this fascinating narrative until, by the end of the twentieth century, a large, colorful cast of characters and communities has wheeled and dealed, built, diverted, and connived its way to an entirely different statewide waterscape.</p><p>"This revised and expanded edition of Professor Hundley's seminal history now includes a fascinating treatment of important developments in the California water arena during the 1990s.

Largely ignored by the world&#x2019;s media, the resulting humanitarian disaster and full-scale famine threatens millions. <i>Destroying Yemen</i> offers the first in-depth historical account of the transnational origins of this war, placing it in the illuminating context of Yemen&#x2019;s relationship with major powers since the Cold War. Bringing new sources and a deep understanding to bear on Yemen&#x2019;s profound, unwitting implication in international affairs, this explosive book ultimately tells an even larger story of today&#x2019;s political economy of global capitalism, development, and the war on terror as disparate actors intersect in Arabia.</p><p>&#x201c;America's decision to plunge into war in Yemen has proven disastrous, but the background of this crisis remains obscure to most outsiders. <i>Destroying Yemen</i> is a meticulous and fascinating account of how Yemen was pushed into crisis&#x2014;and why the United States intervened on the side of the aggressor.&#x201d;&#x2014;Stephen Kinzer, author of <i>The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War</i><br><br> "This is one of the best books I have read in recent years, and for sure the best on the Middle East.

It presents a distinctively hard-hitting interpretation of recent developments in Yemen, in all their tragedy, while also linking them to the earlier twentieth century in a manner that is striking, bold, and inventive. Isa Blumi shows how the components of U.S.-led imperialism in the form of the development industry, international financial policy, the military-industrial complex, and the oil-dollar nexus have devastated a once agrarian society of great historical depth and ecological skill.

But he has also made enemies among the rulers in Jerusalem, who fear his power and his influence and who have conspired to put an end to him by whatever means possible. Mordechai ben Uzziels life couldn't be any worse. His daughter, Miriam, has vanished from Rome, spirited away by none other than his old nemesis &#x2014; Simeon ben David. Meanwhile, Mordechais credibility with the Sanhedrin is jeopardized when the council learns that his own daughter has become a disciple of this so-called Messiah. Simeon ben David's life could not be any better. After struggling to follow the Savior and to testify of his knowledge that Jesus is the Son of God, Simeon has found peace and joy in following the Master. More than that, he has found love; he and Miriam will be betrothed before the feast of Hanukkah. The family of David ben Joseph continues to follow Jesus, though the Saviors teachings now carry an undercurrent of sorrow and unsettling prophecy. And despite increasing danger, Jesus' ministry draws him inexorably toward Jerusalem. Along the way, Jesus performs miracles of astounding power; healing a woman afflicted for almost two decades, restoring sight to a man born blind, and raising Lazarus after four days in the grave. But not everyone is thrilled to hear Jesus declare, I am the light of the world; I am the bread of life during the Feast of the Tabernacles. As the end of Jesus' ministry and his life approaches, the lines are swiftly and solidly drawn between those who will stand for Jesus and those who will tear him down. The final volume of The Kingdom and the Crown series, , details the last week of Jesus' life his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the spiritually fulfilling Last Supper, and the crowning achievement of the atonement that begins in the Garden of Gethsemane and culminates in the Garden Tomb. In The Kingdom and the Crown trilogy, Gerald N. Lund has given us the chance to behold the man known as Jesus of Nazareth, to experience what it must have been like to walk and talk with the Master.</p><p>In Behold the Man, the final volume, Jesus continues to perform miracles even as those in Jerusalem fear his growing influence. David ben Joseph&#39;s family must decide if they will remain faithful to the teachings of Jesus despite unsettling prophecies concerning Jesus&#39; death.Gerald N.

He has done extensive graduate work in New Testament studies at Pepperdine University in Los Angeles and studied Hebrew at the University of Judaism in Hollywood.

Characterized by a mastery of line and composition, and noted for lyrical scenes of exquisite beauty, the genius of Japanese art has bequeathed to the world a remarkable and distinctive design legacy. <br>This exceptionally versatile collection of traditional Japanese designs and motifs presents the working artist with a treasury of 360 copyright-free designs. All have been especially adapted by noted artist Carol Belanger Grafton for ready use by illustrators, designers, and craftspeople. Painstaking effort has been made to preserve the original spirit and subtlety of detail while simultaneously sharpening the lines and enhancing the reproducibility of the designs and motifs. <br>There are several lovely ceramic and textile patterns. However, most of the design motifs in this compendium were taken from woodblock prints. This particular medium was invented in China and introduced to Japan before 1000 A.D., flourishing thereafter and reaching its zenith in the Ukiyo-e ("floating world") school of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Accompanying these depictions of people in traditional garb, and accessories such as fans, keys, kites, and umbrellas, are many charmingly decorative family crests arranged in mostly circular configurations. Also included are full-page compositions of bold geometric design, vignettes of ethereal delicacy, as well as a generous sampling of nature's bounty: cherries, radishes, plum blossoms, lions, elephants, dogs, cranes, parrots, turtles, butterflies, even demons and dragons, and much more&#x2015;often in several arrangements, many with reversed images.<br>Artists, designers, illustrators, students, and teachers will find this indispensable collection of 360 traditional Japanese designs and motifs rendered in clean, crisp, black-and-white, copyright-free illustrations to be a remarkably fertile source of illustrative inspiration and design solutions.</p><p></p><h2>Big Trouble in Little China Legacy Edition Book One</h2><p>The authorized and in-continuity sequel to the cult hit film Big Trouble in Little China, co-written by its creator, John Carpenter, presented in a new value priced format!&nbsp;<br><br>Jack Burton, a macho, truck-driving adventurer, finds a stowaway demon hiding on his rig, The Pork Chop Express, but that soon becomes the least of his troubles.

She was married on the Grand Canal in Venice, and now lives in London with her family.</p><p>Florence, June 1482<br>1<br>Florence looks like gold and smells like sulphur.<br>The buildings are massive, gorgeous, and epic. They are made of glowing gilded stone and silver marble. Yet the smells&#x2014;animal dung, human waste, rotting meat and vegetables left in the gutter from market&#x2014;would make a tanner blanch. In fact, the city is a mass of contradictions. It is built for giants, with the huge loggias, toothsome palaces, and massy pillars, yet the Florentines are a tiny people and scuttle around the plinths like brightly dressed pygmies. The only citizens that truly fit such a scale are the statues that wrestle their stony bouts in the Piazza della Signoria.<br>Florence is beautiful and brutal. Her beauty is skin deep; underneath, the blood runs very near the surface. Wondrous palaces and chapels stand right next to the Bargello jail, a place worse than the Inferno. In every church, heaven and hell coexist on the walls. These opposite fates sit cheek by jowl on the ceilings too, divided only by the crossribs. In the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore, our great cathedral, angels and demons whirl around together in a celestial fortune&#x2019;s wheel. Paradise and damnation are so close, so very close. Even the food is a contradiction. Take my favorite food, carpaccio: slabs of raw meat fair running with blood. It&#x2019;s delicious, but something had to die to make it.<br>On the streets, too, gods and monsters live together. I have no illusions. I am one of the monsters&#x2014;Luciana Vetra, part-time model and full-time whore. The preachers spill poison about the likes of me from their pulpits, and decent women spit at me in the street. The Lord and the Devil compete for the souls of the Florentines, and sometimes I think the Devil is winning; if you enter the Battistero and look upon the mosaics of the Last Judgment, which bit do you look at first? Heaven, with the do-gooding angels and their haloes and hallelujahs? Or hell, with the long-eared Lucifer devouring the damned? And if you were to read Signor Dante&#x2019;s Divina commedia, would you start with Paradiso, with its priests and pope-holy prelates? Or the Inferno, where the skies rain blood and feckless nobles fry feet first? You know the answer. So there was I, a jade and a jezebel, reviled by decent folk, touting one or more of the Deadly Sins on the street. A lost sheep. Sometimes, though, a shepherd will come among us, one of the godly, selling salvation.<br>And that&#x2019;s how I met Brother Guido della Torre.<br>It was not an auspicious meeting. He did not see me at my best. I was dressed in my best, to be sure, for I am always aware of the passing trade. But I happened to be sitting on the balustrade of the river, pissing into the Arno. Framed poetically by the saffron arches of the Ponte Vecchio looming behind. In fairness, it would not have been immediately obvious to the good brother what I was doing, as my skirts were voluminous. But I had just come from Bembo&#x2019;s bed, was on my way to Signor Botticelli&#x2019;s studio, and the quantity of muscat I had drunk for breakfast begged for evacuation.<br>Actually, I&#x2019;m telling this all wrong&#x2014;before we go on to talk about Brother Guido, and the right path, let me give you a glimpse of my old life, and the wrong one. Because unless you know about Bembo, and how I came to model for Signor Botticelli, you will never get to understand the secret, and the secret is the story. So let&#x2019;s go back to... the night before? No; no need to take you through all the depraved sex acts we committed for pleasure on Bembo&#x2019;s part and payment on mine. That morning would be time enough: Friday, the thirteenth of June, an unlucky day for so many reasons.

Here, Johnston brings to life a breathtaking love story&#x2014;between the Blackthornes' oldest son and the Creeds' beautiful daughter&#x2014;a magnificent novel of passion, vengeance, and star-crossed love.<br><br>Trace Blackthorne was taught from the cradle to take what he wanted. And he wanted Callie Creed. Eleven years ago, the feud between their families had torn them apart. But now Trace has come home, a ruthless hard-eyed stranger, making her an offer she couldn't refuse: marry him and save her struggling family from financial ruin. But the secrets of the past return to haunt them. And Callie is once again compelled to make an impossible choice&#x2014;between the family who desperately needs her and the only man she has ever loved.</p><p>Setting: Present-day Texas<br> Sensuality Rating: 7<p> The Blackthornes and the Creeds had been at war for generations, and when Trace Blackthorne and Callie Creed fell in love as college students, the hostilities didn't stop. Family loyalty eventually drove the two young lovers apart; Trace disappeared from their small Texas town while Callie married her father's foreman, bore two children, and became a young widow. It isn't until Trace's father has a heart attack that he returns to Texas and comes looking for Callie, the one woman he's never been able to forget. But although Callie has never stopped loving Trace, she harbors a secret that could destroy any chance of a future with him.</p><p> Just when it seems that the two lovers may work out a solution, tragedy strikes the Creeds. Once again their family problems may be a direct result of the bitter feud with the Blackthornes that has so badly damaged the family in the past. And this time, the stunning truth may drive Trace and Callie apart forever.</p><p> With <i>The Cowboy</i>, Johnston has concocted a compelling story of jealousy and greed, passion and hate, combined it with an intriguing look at the world of cutting horse competition, and set the tale against the backdrop of working Texas ranches. Readers will be delighted to know that <i>The Cowboy</i> is only the first in a trilogy about the Blackthornes and Creeds that will soon be continued in <i>The Lone Wolf</i>, the story of Owen Blackthorne and Bayleigh Creed. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p>"Joan Johnston [creates] unforgettable subplots and characters who make every fine thread weave into a touching tapestry."<br>--<i>Affaire de Coeur</i><br><br>"Like Lavyrle Spencer, Ms. Johnston writes of intense emotions and tender passions that seem so real that readers will feel each one of them." <br>--<i>Rave Reviews</i></p><h2>The Grace of Law: A Study of Puritan Theology</h2><p>In this study, Ernest Kevan investigates the works of numerous seventeenth-century theologians to provide an overview of a Puritan understanding of the law in relationship to the life of the Christian. After describing the Puritans and the antinomian controversy that developed among them, Kevan demonstrates how the orthodox view among the Puritans regarded the moral law as an expression of God s majesty established as a guide for man s blessedness and a measure to expose sin. He then proceeds to show how the law relates to God s people after the fall in the context of the covenant of grace. Great care is used to explain the relation of Christ s work to the law, the ongoing moral obligation Christians have to the law, the idea of gospel obedience, and the Christian s freedom from the law s condemnation. Although the Puritans saw law and grace as opposing principles regarding one s justification, they did teach about how God ultimately uses the law in the life of the believer for His gracious purposes.</p><p>Ernest F. Kevan served as the first principal of London Bible College, now London School of Theology, where he labored until his death in 1965.Ernest Kevan s The Grace of Law gives us a library of biblically balanced Puritan wisdom condensed into one book. Dr. Kevan has masterfully drawn and woven together the threads of several dozen Puritan writers on God s law into a beautiful tapestry of their theology of grace. As the law relates to all of life and godliness, readers will find The Grace of Law a wise and concise guide with regard to a broad range of crucial topics such as God s covenants, justification by faith alone, and the practical third use of the law to direct the Christian s life. I first read this much-needed book in 1977 and was profoundly influenced by it, but today it is needed more than ever. I pray that this reprint will serve as a wake-up call and a pedagogical tool for a church being lulled to sleep by cheap grace and antinomianism. --Joel R.

As a writer of provocative poems and stories, she has encountered success along with snark: one critic dismissed her as &#x201c;Charles Bukowski in a sundress.&#x201d; (&#x201c;Why not Walt Whitman in a sparkly tutu?&#x201d; she muses.) Now, in this utterly original memoir in essays, she opens up to chronicle the joys and indignities in the life of a writer wandering through middle age.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Addonizio vividly captures moments of inspiration at the writing desk (or bed) and adventures on the road&#x2014;from a champagne-and-vodka-fueled one-night stand at a writing conference to sparsely attended readings at remote Midwestern colleges. Her crackling, unfiltered wit brings colorful life to pieces like &#x201c;What Writers Do All Day,&#x201d; &#x201c;How to Fall for a Younger Man,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Necrophilia&#x201d; (that is, sexual attraction to men who are dead inside). And she turns a tender yet still comic eye to her family: her father, who sparked her love of poetry; her mother, a former tennis champion who struggled through Parkinson&#x2019;s at the end of her life; and her daughter, who at a young age chanced upon some erotica she had written for&nbsp;<i>Penthouse</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> At once intimate and outrageous, Addonizio&#x2019;s memoir radiates all the wit and heartbreak and ever-sexy grittiness that her fans have come to love&#x2014;and that new readers will not soon forget.</p><p><b>Kim Addonizio</b> is an award-winning author of fiction, essays, and poetry. She has received numerous honors for her work, including the John Ciardi Lifetime Achievement Award and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.

She is also the author of two popular writing guides for poets, <i>The Poet&#x2019;s Companion</i> and <i>Ordinary Genius</i>, and teaches and performs internationally. She divides her time between New York City and the Bay Area.&#x201c;In poet Kim Addonizio&#x2019;s unflinching, often hilarious &#x2018;confessions,&#x2019; the excesses and debauchery are not prelude but process, not a state from which to be saved but a series of experiences and memories to save, and savor. In this memoir-in-essays, Addonizio wields a sharp eye and a sharper pen. . . . Much as it revels in the poet&#x2019;s life as a fun-loving bad girl, this stunning book is at its most gorgeous when it reveals its author&#x2019;s great big heart.&#x201d;<br> <i><b>&#x2014;The Boston Globe</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Addictively compelling . . . One expects a lot from a memoirist whose remarkable life is her art and whose remarkable art is her life, and <i>Bukowski in a Sundress</i> does not disappoint. Addonizio&#x2019;s acerbic commentary on the business of writing is equally poignant and hilarious. . . . If there is any justice at all in the literary world (a premise Addonizio might dispute), <i>Bukowski in a Sundress</i>&nbsp;will reach the wide-ranging audience its brave, brilliant author deserves.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A poet and writer with decades of accolades, Addonizio . . . comes across as the outsider-insider, wine-swilling but clear-eyed. . . .

Feel a shiver of happy anticipation, followed by relief: <i>Bukowski in a Sundress</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;isn&#x2019;t a shimmery summer beach read. This memoir-in-essays is an unflinching look at middle age, men, ailing parents, alcohol, and the enduring commitment to serious writing. . . . Books like&nbsp;this&nbsp;can save us.

In short, Addonizio is my kind of flawed, imperfect creative teacher. . . . At moments, she&#x2019;s a saint. At others, she&#x2019;s a mess. But through it all, she&#x2019;s paying attention, keeping a sense of humor, and writing it all down.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;KQED Arts</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It takes bravery to be as honest, and as tart, as Addonizio is, even in the face of the reproach that comes when you tell the whole truth instead of pretending. This kind of writing flies in the face of our societal preference for curated Instagram feeds and selective Facebook posts. . . . She sheds elegant light on her encounters with language, the meaning of poetry, and what it really means to be a writer. She&#x2019;s privileged to be able to lead a creative existence, yes. But don&#x2019;t say she hasn&#x2019;t paid the price. We&#x2019;re just as privileged, as readers, to be trusted with her confessions, which are designed to make us feel but also to teach us something.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Toronto Star</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Addonizio is brash and tender, pissed off and funny, well armored and wounded. Emotions, bravado, and empathy run high in her award-garnering poetry and novels, and she now taps into the wellsprings of her creativity in this rollicking and wrenching memoir-in-essays. . . . Always vital, clever, and seductive, Addonizio, a secular Anne Lamott, a spiritual aunt to Lena Dunham, delivers shock and awe, humor and pathos with panache.&#x201d;<br><i> &#x2014;<b>Booklist</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Filled with Addonizio&#x2019;s usual jaunty wit, sarcasm, and irreverence. This &#x2018;Emily Dickinson with a strap-on,&#x2019; as she calls herself, is ruthlessly honest and writes so well that whatever she's excoriating or dissing or musing about becomes immediately fascinating. . . . An unrelenting, authentic, literary midnight confession.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;<br><br></b>"This is Addonizio in a nutshell: funny, frank, vulgar, and just a little bit vulnerable. . . . Her writing is charmingly self-aware, at times confessional (a descriptor she likens to being tarred and feathered), but never apologetic. She wears her sexual misadventures, her drinking habits, and her anxieties over abandonment and failure like a badge, if not of honor, then of identity.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Publishers Weekly</b><br><br>&#x201c;It would be easy to compare&nbsp;Kim Addonizio&#x2019;s memoir with the writings of Anne Lamott or the humor of Amy Schumer, but that would not do justice to her quirky, irreverent, incredibly funny writing. In these short essays about her personal and writing life, Addonizio takes aim primarily at herself. She brings humor to middle age, life as a writer with a certain level of achievement, her drinking and drug use, many one-night stands, her marriages that have failed and falling in love with a younger man. . . . Yet, unlike many memoirists who cover similar topics, she writes with a tone and attitude that leaves the reader wanting just a tiny bit more, kind of like the vodka and lemonade she&#x2019;s fond of imbibing.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Shelf Awareness</i>&nbsp;</b></p><h2>The Message of Deuteronomy (The Bible Speaks Today Series)</h2><p>Reading Deuteronomy can be like standing before Israel with Moses, hearing him address us as a future generation of the covenant people of God.

It didn&#x2019;t feel like it. Not if you were standing outdoors on the brand-new Nesselrode Plaza. A hard and bitter wind with a cold edge to it blew across the wide-open space of the plaza. Nobody was surprised. This was Chicago, the Windy City. It was tough to be shocked when it lived up to its name.<br><br>But this wind was <i>cold</i>. The plaza itself was only half a block from the lake, so the wind was straight from Canada, and it&#x2019;d had plenty of time to lose warmth and gather strength as it blew down from the Arctic Circle and across Lake Michigan.<br><br>Most people would have put their heads down and hurried across the large open space to find some shelter from the wind. The small crowd gathered here in the arctic morning air didn&#x2019;t have that option. So they clustered together around the podium that stood in the center of the plaza, in the shadow of a huge statue. It was brand-new, too, so new it was still draped with a cover, pending the dramatic unveiling. And the people who stood waiting, stamping their feet and trying to hunch away from the wind, devoutly wished it would be unveiled quickly so they could go someplace warm.<br><br>But of course, few of them were here by choice. They were mostly reporters and civic leaders, here because they had to be. The new Nesselrode Plaza was supposed to be important, the keystone to revitalizing this area of the lakefront. A US congresswoman was in attendance, a handsome woman in her fifties. Next to her stood a gray-haired African-American man, a state senator, and an elderly man so bundled up against the cold you could barely tell his species, let alone that he was a prominent federal judge. There was even a tall, rugged-looking man, with a neat beard that didn&#x2019;t hide the large scar running down his cheek, in the full dress uniform of a Coast Guard admiral.<br><br>And of course Arthur Nesselrode himself was here, the billionaire who had donated the statue and given the plaza its name. That meant the mayor had to be here, too. And the mayor had to give a speech that fit the occasion, made Arthur Nesselrode feel truly important and therefore happy to write more big checks in the future&#x2014;and that meant a <i>long </i>speech.<br><br>Circling the perimeter of the small and shivering crowd were a couple of armed guards, hired because this was an expensive statue, made by a famous modern artist. There had been rumors that a cartel drug lord wanted the statue, rumors the mayor took seriously.<br><br>The guards did not. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s gonna steal this fucker,&#x201d; Denny Kirkaldi said to his partner, Bill Greer. He pointed at the base of the statue. &#x201c;Lookit&#x2014;twelve bolts, thick as my wrist, holding it down, and the fucking thing has to weigh ten tons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twelve and a half,&#x201d; Greer said. Kirkaldi looked at him with surprise, and Greer shrugged. &#x201c;It was in the paper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, so twelve and a <i>half </i>tons. <i>Tons</i>, right? So who&#x2019;s gonna steal something that weighs twelve and a half tons? That&#x2019;s fucking stupid!&#x201d;<br><br>Greer shook his head. &#x201c;We get paid, even if it&#x2019;s stupid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We should get paid extra for stupid,&#x201d; Kirkaldi said, &#x201c;when it&#x2019;s this fucking cold.&#x201d;<br><br>Greer just shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that cold,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>But it was cold, and the wet wind off the lake made it feel even colder. As the mayor&#x2019;s speech went on&#x2014;and on&#x2014;it seemed even colder to the people who had to stand and listen to the praise being heaped on Arthur Nesselrode. Those who knew Nesselrode, or knew about him, were well aware that there was not very much praiseworthy about him. He had made his billions as owner and CEO of Nesselrode Pharmaceuticals. His company owned patents on a number of important drugs&#x2014;the most significant being Zanagen, the most effective of the new genebased treatments for a number of difficult, and formerly fatal, cancers. Zanagen was truly a miracle drug, and the mayor mentioned it prominently in his speech. But as a politician, he very wisely didn&#x2019;t mention that Arthur Nesselrode had set the price for his wonderful remedy at half a million dollars per dose. No amount of criticism in the press, pleas from doctors, or even censure from the US Congress could shake him from this grotesquely inflated price.<br><br>Nesselrode did not become a billionaire by acts of kindness and charity. Anyone who&#x2019;d had the misfortune of crossing him would readily testify that he was not a nice man. Some even suggested he was a sociopath, and therefore immune from any feelings of guilt or shame. But Nesselrode was aware that public opinion could affect stock prices. And so he was here today to bolster his image by donating a huge $50 million steel statue to the city of Chicago and paying millions more to build this plaza that carried his name.<br><br>The money was insignificant to Nesselrode. He could give away this much every day for a month and still have a few billion left over. And like most men with this kind of wealth, Arthur Nesselrode felt himself insulated against the normal slings and arrows of life. But wealth was not sufficient to insulate him from the temperature. He was cold, and he didn&#x2019;t like it. But the mayor was praising him, after all. It takes a better man than Arthur Nesselrode to cut that short.<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus, lookit that,&#x201d; Kirkaldi said, pointing out over the lake, where an enormous helicopter was circling. &#x201c;Thing is huge!&#x201d;<br><br>Greer glanced up. &#x201c;Chinook,&#x201d; he said. His partner stared at him. &#x201c;I serviced them in the Corps,&#x201d; Greer explained. &#x201c;They can lift seventeen tons. Plus crew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I hope the fucker stays away, we got enough wind,&#x201d; Kirkaldi said, and the two resumed their circuit of the statue.<br><br>And the mayor went on with his speech. He was well over ten minutes now and didn&#x2019;t seem to be slowing down. Arthur Nesselrode glanced at his watch for the seventh time. Even hearing how wonderful he was had started to get tedious. He had been told the ceremony would be brief&#x2014;a quick speech, and then the mayor would hand him an electronic box with a toggle switch.<br><br> Nesselrode would then say a few words himself and flip the switch, which would cause the veil to slip off the statue, and then the fountain would start up at the base, and they could all go back to work. Nesselrode wanted to be back at work. He was working on a hostile takeover of a French company that had had some promising results with a new synthetic insulin.<br><br>And damn it, it was really <i>cold</i>. Nesselrode wasn&#x2019;t dressed for it, and he didn&#x2019;t like it. He was not accustomed to being inconvenienced, even by the weather. And so, as the mayor passed the fifteen-minute mark in his speech of praise that even the billionaire himself knew was a load of crap, he acted.<br><br>When the mayor paused to take a breath, Nesselrode stepped forward. With the confidence only billionaires can feel, he placed an arm on the mayor&#x2019;s shoulder and pushed him to one side. He grabbed the microphone and, with a large and incredibly false smile, said, &#x201c;Thank you, Mr. Mayor, you&#x2019;re much too kind. And on behalf of Nesselrode Pharmaceuticals, the true House of Miracles, I would just like to say, to you and to the people of Chicago, it is a great honor and privilege to be able to give you this wonderful work of art. And so,&#x201d; he said, lifting the large electronic box resting on the podium, &#x201c;I hereby dedicate . . . Nesselrode Plaza!&#x201d; He raised the box high over his head and flipped the toggle switch.<br><br>Several impressive things happened at the same time.<br><br>There was a brilliant flash of blue light from the electronic box, accompanied by a sharp and crackling <i>BANG!, </i>and Arthur Nesselrode pitched over and lay motionless behind the podium, smoke rising from his blackened hands. This was followed immediately by twelve sharp and rapid explosions, one after another, from around the base of the statue. And while the crowd was still stunned and blinking, the Coast Guard admiral stepped forward and began shouting orders.<br><br>&#x201c;Clear a space here! Give him some room!&#x201d; he said as he knelt beside Arthur Nesselrode.<br><br>The mayor knelt beside him as well. &#x201c;Jesus, what happened?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Electric shock. Came from that box,&#x201d; the admiral said as he felt for a pulse. &#x201c;This man needs immediate medical attention!&#x201d; He pulled a radio from his pocket and spoke urgently into it. Then he turned his attention back to Nesselrode and began to give him CPR. &#x201c;All right, that&#x2019;s my chopper offshore,&#x201d; he told the mayor. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll airlift him to the hospital.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh,&#x201d; the mayor said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think we could&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stow it!&#x201d; the admiral snapped, pressing hard on Nesselrode&#x2019;s chest. &#x201c;I need you to time me here! Start the count!&#x201d;<br><br>And the mayor, who had seen CPR performed on TV, looked at his watch and began counting out loud.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell happened?&#x201d; Kirkaldi demanded. &#x201c;What were those explosions?&#x201d;<br><br>Greer shook his head. &#x201c;Around the base of the statue,&#x201d; he said. The two of them hurried over, and Greer knelt to examine one spot still smoking from the series of blasts. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s sheared the bolt,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All the bolts!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Kirkaldi said. &#x201c;This thing could fall over, crush somebody!&#x201d; He frowned at his partner. &#x201c;Why would somebody&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Greer stood up. &#x201c;Terrorists,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We better tell the mayor.&#x201d; Kirkaldi nodded. &#x201c;You tell him, I&#x2019;ll move the crowd back.&#x201d;<br><br>On the podium, the Coast Guard admiral continued CPR compressions on Nesselrode&#x2019;s chest while the mayor counted for him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a pulse,&#x201d; the admiral said. He glanced up. &#x201c;And here&#x2019;s my chopper.&#x201d; He stood up and waved at the helicopter.<br><br>With a huge swirl of wind, the Chinook descended toward the platform, lowering a medevac basket. &#x201c;Clear away!&#x201d; the admiral yelled. &#x201c;Mr. Mayor, you need to get all these folks out of the way.&#x201d;<br><br>The mayor nodded and began to urge the crowd away, off the platform. He was the last person down, and as he stepped onto the top stair, he turned just in time to see Nesselrode, in the medevac basket, rising up into the air&#x2014;<br><br>&#x2014;and a second thick steel cable with a large metal hook on the end unspooling downward, to the admiral&#x2019;s waiting hand. Frowning, the mayor paused on the top stair. What the hell . . . ?<br><br>His puzzlement grew as the admiral grabbed this second cable, stepped to the front of the platform, and swung out toward the statue. But the mayor&#x2019;s confusion turned to alarm as the admiral, perched on the statue, whipped the cable around it several times, stuck the hook into the wrapped cable, and then climbed upward, hand over hand, and disappeared into the side door of the helicopter.<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus Christ,&#x201d; the mayor said. He couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else. He just stood mute as the powerful Chinook climbed upward, taking the statue with it. One of the security guards appeared beside him, lifting his pistol to fire at the chopper. The mayor slapped his hand down. &#x201c;Mr. Nesselrode is in there!&#x201d; he said, and the guard kept his pistol lowered.<br><br>The two stood side by side and watched as the helicopter flew away, far out over the lake, the brand-new $50 million statue dangling be- neath it.<br><br>And with Arthur Nesselrode, billionaire big-pharma CEO, inside.<br><br>Arthur Nesselrode came slowly back to consciousness with no idea where he was or what was happening. His entire body ached&#x2014;but especially his chest. It felt like he&#x2019;d been beaten. Beneath him he felt a hard and cold surface, and it was thrumming with vibrations from<br>some kind of powerful machine.<br><br>It took several minutes of concentration and hard work, but he finally managed to open his eyes. Hovering above him was a face he didn&#x2019;t know. He frowned, tried to focus. The man was wearing a uniform&#x2014;the admiral who had been standing on the platform behind the mayor? But that made no sense&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re in a helicopter,&#x201d; the admiral said. He reached behind him and slid open the chopper&#x2019;s door. Immediately, the freezing wind whipped in at them. &#x201c;See?&#x201d;<br><br>It was terribly uncomfortable, but it revived Nesselrode a little bit. He blinked and licked his lips.<br> &#x201c;Medevac . . . ?&#x201d; he managed to say. His voice was an unfamiliar rasp.<br><br>The admiral smiled. It was not a reassuring smile. &#x201c;Not quite,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Nesselrode shook his head. It hurt. &#x201c;Then . . . why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Insurance,&#x201d; the admiral said. &#x201c;To keep them from shooting at me.&#x201d; Nesselrode closed his eyes again. Nothing was making sense.<br><br>Unless&#x2014;<br><br>He opened his eyes again. &#x201c;Tell me again how much you charge for one dose of Zanagen?&#x201d; the admiral said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s . . . ,&#x201d; Nesselrode croaked. He frowned. &#x201c;You&#x2014;you&#x2019;re not . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You guessed it!&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really an admiral!&#x201d;<br><br>Nesselrode tried to sit up and discovered that his hands and feet were duct-taped. With that, the last piece clicked into place. Of course; he was being kidnapped. &#x201c;I can pay,&#x201d; he rasped. The man in the admiral&#x2019;s uniform didn&#x2019;t answer. &#x201c;I . . . have money. Lots of it,&#x201d; Nesselrode said.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough to buy anything you want?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nesselrode said.<br><br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; the admiral said. He grabbed Nesselrode roughly and sat him up in the chopper&#x2019;s doorway. Lake Michigan gleamed far below. &#x201c;Could you buy a big fancy yacht?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nesselrode said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; the admiral said, &#x201c;now would be a really good time.&#x201d; And he pushed Arthur Nesselrode out the door, leaning out and watching until he saw a tiny splash far below in the freezing water of Lake Michigan.<br><br>&#x201c;Bastard,&#x201d; the admiral said. Then he closed the door.<br><br>I watched my buyer&#x2019;s guys secure the statue onto the bed of a huge semi rig. They looked like what they were&#x2014;thugs.

I mean, if somebody is as rich as this guy was, they have to have big holes in their morals. Look at me.<br><br>&#x201c;Paid <i>in full</i>,&#x201d; the thug said. He looked offended. &#x201c;He <i>said </i>so!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it is,&#x201d; I said. He turned to go. &#x201c;Just a second,&#x201d; I said. I got my little black electronic control box and flipped a switch.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; he asked, frowning at me.<br> &#x201c;The bomb,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I just disarmed it.&#x201d; <br>He shook his head. &#x201c;What bomb?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The one inside the statue,&#x201d; I said, giving him a really big and cheery smile.<br><br>He goggled at me. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a bomb in the statue?&#x201d; he said, kind of stupid.<br><br>&#x201c;Trust&#x2014;but verify,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Have a nice day!&#x201d; Before he could tell me what he thought about that, I was into my waiting car and away, $50 million richer.<br><br>And no happier. In fact, I was feeling dirty, mean, edgy, and antsy. Fifty million reasons to feel good, and I didn&#x2019;t. I mean, the money was nice. And the whole thing had come off without a hitch, just like I had planned it. No reason to do anything but smile and sing happy songs as I drove away. But I just kept looking in the rearview mirror and hissing. Why?<br><br>Because. It had all been too easy, and I hate that.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know why that is. It just is. If it&#x2019;s too easy, I always feel like it&#x2019;s got to be a trap, or I made some stupid mistake, or&#x2014;hell, I don&#x2019;t know. I just don&#x2019;t like things to be too easy. And in spite of the cold, this had been a stroll through the fucking park on a summer day. It was done, and I had the money to prove it, and now all my nerves were standing up and vibrating like somebody was whacking at them with a dull machete. Mom had an expression for this feeling.

But the rest of us simply fall in love with it&#x2014;and with its wonderfully charming and intelligent heroine, Elizabeth Bennet.</p><p>We are captivated not only by the novel&#x2019;s romantic suspense but also by the fascinations of the world we visit in its pages. The life of the English country gentry at the turn of the nineteenth century is made as real to us as our own, not only by Jane Austen&#x2019;s wit and feeling but by her subtle observation of the way people behave in society and how we are true or treacherous to each other and ourselves.</p></p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

In their rural settings and their poor, uneducated protagonists, Summer and Ethan Frome represent a sharp departure from Wharton's familiar depictions of the urban upper class. Charity Royall lives unhappily with her hard-drinking adoptive father in an isolated village, until a visiting architect awakens her sexual passion and the hope for escape. Exploring Charity's relation to her father and her lover, Wharton delves into dark cultural territory: repressed sexuality, small-town prejudice, and, in subtle hints, incest.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Considered by some to be her finest work, Edith Wharton's <i>Summer</i> created a sensation when first published in 1917, as it was one of the first novels to deal honestly with a young woman's sexual awakening. <i>Summer</i> is the story of proud and independent Charity Royall, a child of mountain moonshiners adopted by a family in a poor New England town, who has a passionate love affair with Lucius Harney, an educated young man from the city. Wharton broke the conventions of woman's romantic fiction by making Charity a thoroughly contemporary woman--in touch with her feelings and sexuality, yet kept from love and the larger world she craves by the overwhelming pressures of environment and heredity. Praised for its realism and candor by such writers as Joseph Conrad and Henry James and compared to Flaubert's <i>Madame Bovary</i>, <i>Summer</i> was one of Wharton's personal favorites of all her novels and remains as fresh and relevant today as when it was first written.Edith Wharton was born Edith Newbold Jones on January 24, 1862, during the American Civil War. Wharton published her first short story in 1891; her first story collection, The Greater Inclination, in 1899; a novella called The Touchstone in 1900; and her first novel, a historical romance called The Valley of Decision, in 1902. The book that made Wharton famous was The House of Mirth, published in 1905. She died in 1937.</p><h2>The Story of Palo Duro Canyon (Double Mountain Books)</h2><p>Of the canyons that break the eastern edge of the Staked Plains, Palo Duro is by far the most spectacular. As one approaches the edge, the earth opens up into a vast gash, a geological and ecological wonder. And whether you come to Palo Duro as a novice or veteran canyoneer, the thrill and the mystery are always intense.How did the canyon get here? What caused the vari-color of the walls and formations? Why do some formations stand completely separated from the canyon walls? Did the little stream running along the canyon floor form this canyon all by itself? Who were the first people to find this canyon and how did they react? On this last question imagination goes to work and contemplates what ancient people must have felt when they, even less aware than we, stumbled upon the chasm rim and quickly realized that they had found a bonanza, an immense concentration of water, wood, game, and protection&#x2014;all they needed to sustain life.&#x2014;Frederick W.

Sawyer. </b></p><p>An alien shuttle craft lands outside the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. A six-legged, two-armed alien emerges, who says, in perfect English, "Take me to a paleontologist." </p><p>It seems that Earth, and the alien's home planet, and the home planet of another alien species traveling on the alien mother ship, all experienced the same five cataclysmic events at about the same time (one example of these "cataclysmic events" would be the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs). Both alien races believe this proves the existence of God: i.e. he's obviously been playing with the evolution of life on each of these planets.</p><p>From this provocative launch point, Sawyer tells a fast-paced, and morally and intellectually challenging, SF story that just grows larger and larger in scope. The evidence of God's universal existence is not universally well received on Earth, nor even immediately believed. And it reveals nothing of God's nature. In fact. it poses more questions than it answers.</p><p>When a supernova explodes out in the galaxy but close enough to wipe out life on all three home-worlds, the big question is, Will God intervene or is this the sixth cataclysm:?</p><p><i>Calculating God</i> is SF on the grand scale.</p><p><i>Calculating God</i> is a 2001 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel.</p></p><p>Creationists rarely find sympathy in the ranks of science fiction authors--or fans, for that matter. And while Robert J. Sawyer doesn't exactly make peace with evangelicals on the issue, <i>Calculating God</i> has to be one of the more thoughtful and sympathetic SF portrayals you'll find of religion and intelligent design. But that should come as no surprise from this crafty Canadian: in the Nebula Award-winning <i>Terminal Experiment</i>, Sawyer speculated on what would happen if hard evidence were ever found for the human soul; in <i>Calculating God</i>, he turns science on its head again when earth is invaded by theists from outer space.<p> The book starts out like the setup for some punny science fiction joke: An alien walks into a museum and asks if he can see a paleontologist. But the arachnid ET hasn't come aboard a rowboat with the Pope and Stephen Hawking (although His Holiness does request an audience later). Landing at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the spacefarer (named Hollus) asks to compare notes on mass extinctions with resident dino-scientist Thomas Jericho. A shocked Jericho finds that not only does life exist on other planets, but that every civilization in the galaxy has experienced extinction events at precisely the same time. Armed with that disconcerting information (and a little help from a grand unifying theory), the alien informs Jericho, almost dismissively, that "the primary goal of modern science is to discover why God has behaved as he has and to determine his methods."</p><p> Inventive, fast-paced, and alternately funny and touching, <i>Calculating God</i> sneaks in a well-researched survey of evolution science, exobiology, and philosophy amidst the banter between Hollus and Jericho. But the book also proves to be very moving and character-driven SF, as Jericho--in the face of Hollus's convincing arguments--grapples with his own bitter reasons for not believing in God. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p><b>Robert J.

In this chapter alone, you&#x2019;ll learn how to completely declutter any spot you choose, so that all you&#x2019;re left with are the things you truly need and truly love. If you&#x2019;re looking for more actual space in your life so that you can spread out and write your masterpiece or effortlessly cook a decadent meal, start here.<br><br> Set Up &amp; Sort<br><br> Choose ONE area to tackle: one closet, one surface, or one corner of your living room. Small steps to victory. It may be easier to start with the less emotional stuff (e.g., the kitchen table rather than the memorabilia passed down by your late grandpa), but there&#x2019;s no &#x201c;right place&#x201d; to begin. Just start.<br><br> Decide on a clear staging area. This is where you&#x2019;ll be sorting out all the things you decide to keep. A table, bed, or couch will do. A designated area of the floor will also work just fine. Can&#x2019;t find a staging area because there&#x2019;s too much stuff everywhere? It&#x2019;s okay to shove piles together for the purpose of clearing a space. Ideally, you&#x2019;re then going to sort through that very stuff anyway.<br><br> Set up the sorting bins nearby. They&#x2019;re for quickly grouping all the clutter that&#x2019;s leaving your life for good. Yeah, you heard me.<br><br> What You Need/Also Helpful<br><br> � A clear staging area� Rubber bands<br><br> � Post-�its� Scissors<br><br> � A Sharpie� Stapler<br><br> � Sorting bins� Tape<br><br> � Trash bags<br><br> Don&#x2019;t let a lack of having every single item on this list keep you from STARTING.<br><br> Improvisation&nbsp;<br><br> is encouraged.<br><br> Set Up Your Sorting Bins<br><br> There are five major categories I use when sorting:<br><br> �Donate<br><br> �Trash<br><br> �Recycle<br><br> �Shred<br><br> �Other Rooms<br><br> Each category has a bin.<br><br> Bin options:<br><br> 1. Cardboard boxes (or &#x201c;Bankers Boxes&#x201d;). Not only can these be used for sorting, but afterward they can turn into storage for items that need a new home.<br><br> 2. Laundry baskets or large containers you already have around the house&#x2014;�provided it&#x2019;s not too time-�consuming to free them up.<br><br> 3. Brown paper grocery bags. Not the ideal level of sturdiness. But they&#x2019;ll work!<br><br> 4. No bins at all (except for actual trash and recycling). Labeled&#x2014;�and clearly defined&#x2014;�piles are fine.<br><br> You can mix and match. Doesn&#x2019;t matter, as long as you use clear labels.<br><br> If you really want to purchase fancy sorting bins, grab some 16-�inch Folding Mesh Cubes (see page 174 in Resources). They&#x2019;re inexpensive, sturdy, and reusable, and they take up almost no room to store. I recommend these as a long-�term product to have on hand for ongoing decluttering and easy transport of donations and discards.<br><br> When you start purging, each discard will go into the Donate, Trash, Recycle, or Shred bin. (Shred will be a fuller bin when you&#x2019;re working exclusively with paper. But you never know what kind of sensitive info you might find among your clutter.)<br><br> Other Rooms<br><br> This bin is for items that actually do have a home, or some semblance of one, around the house. For instance, you&#x2019;ve discovered your vintage Pyrex dish while decluttering the hall closet. Instead of messing with your momentum (and questioning how the heck it got there), chuck it into the Other Rooms bin and keep rolling.<br><br> Label Your Sorting Bins<br><br> Use Post-�its to create labels for your sorting categories. Depending on the type of container you&#x2019;ve got, you can either stick them right on or use a binder clip or clothespin to affix. Or feel free to cut out the labels on page 181 and match them up with the bins of your choosing.<br><br> Start Sorting (and Simultaneously Purging)!<br><br> Put on some tunes, if you like. (Nothing too distracting, though.) Commit to uninterrupted time. Set a timer. Aaaand . . . GO.<br> Move around your space (or desk or closet) from left to right. Or right to left. The point is to curb meandering. Pick up one thing and make a decision. Then pick up the thing that&#x2019;s right next to it. And make a decision.<br><br> If you&#x2019;re dealing with a hard-�to-�reach space, collect a handful at a time and bring it to the staging area. Taking everything out at once tends to create more &#x201c;holy shit&#x201d; overwhelm. Small. Steps.<br><br> The Purge is an all-�important part of the sorting process. Most of what you&#x2019;re going through is stuff you&#x2019;re deciding to banish from your life forever and ever (cackle, cackle). Ideally, you&#x2019;re purging A LOT.<br><br> The rule for purging is incredibly simple:&nbsp;<br><br> If you don&#x2019;t use and/or love it (and I mean superduperlove it and would fall into a deep depression if it was gone), then you must let go of it and move forward with a less cluttered, more blissful life. Cool?<br><br> Questions to Keep in Mind<br><br> �Would you miss it if it was gone?<br><br> �Are you keeping it out of guilt?<br><br> �Are you indifferent to it?<br><br> �Would it make someone else happier than it makes you?<br><br> �Is it ripped or broken? (And: Are you really gonna fix it?)<br><br> �Would you rather have a better version of it?<br><br> �Do you have multiples of the same item?<br><br> �What are the chances you&#x2019;ll need one or four Ethernet cables ever again?<br><br> �Is it expired?<br><br> �Have you used it in the past year? Do you want to use it again?<br><br> �Have you worn it in the past year? Does it fit? (Do clothes that don&#x2019;t fit just make you feel bad about yourself?)<br><br> �Are you keeping it &#x201c;just in case&#x201d;? (Unless we&#x2019;re talking emergency supplies, please don&#x2019;t keep it.)<br><br> �Does it remind you of a shitty memory?<br><br> �Or, if it&#x2019;s a happy memory, how many other possessions remind you of that same experience?<br><br> �Does this thing represent your true self / tell the truth of who you are? No? Get rid of it.<br><br> P.S. What do you need all this stuff for?<br><br> Be brutal with yourself. Your (more joyous) life literally depends on it.<br><br> Pro Tip<br><br> Purging clothes? Empty the pockets. Sometimes you&#x2019;ll find beloved stuff in there. Or money!<br><br> The Keepers<br><br> For some folks, the letting-�go is easy. But what about the stuff you&#x2019;re keeping? On your staging area, sort the Keepers into smaller categories. Remember: these are items you use and/or superlove. Put like items together: batteries with batteries; extra staples with pencils, perhaps, in an Office Supplies category; Band-�Aids and Neosporin both in First Aid.<br><br> Using Post-�its to quickly label new categories as they come up will bring peace of mind throughout the process. For instance, decluttering a packed clothes closet may take two days to complete, and you need to sleep on the very bed that is now covered in piles. So you might take each pile you&#x2019;ve made, store it in a clear plastic bag, and staple a label to the bag. Once you start the process again the next day (or in rare-�but-�acceptable cases, two weeks later), you&#x2019;ll know exactly what you&#x2019;re dealing with and won&#x2019;t have to wonder if that was the Alterations pile or the Try On pile. You dig?<br><br> Additional Categories<br><br> Beyond the basics, you may start such piles as:<br><br> �Bring to Work<br><br> �Return to Mom<br><br> �Maybe*<br><br> Whichever ones make sense for YOU.<br><br> *Maybes are OK.<br><br> Throughout the process, there might be items that are difficult to make a decision about. Even using the purging criteria on pages 9&#x2013;10 as a guide, you&#x2019;re a human who is allowed to be unsure. So to keep things moving, you can have a Maybe pile. However, after a few hours of sorting and purging, here&#x2019;s what usually happens: my clients look back through the Maybe pile and decide that about 95% of it can be donated or otherwise released from their lives. Reclaim what you really need and call it a day.<br><br> Real Life<br><br> Look, it&#x2019;s A-�OK to keep memorabilia. I wouldn&#x2019;t dare give up the 1970s rainbow mug I inherited from Mom and Dad. But it&#x2019;s one mug. Not eleven. And I ultimately wouldn&#x2019;t be shattered if it shattered. Because, while I love it and what it represents . . . it&#x2019;s just a mug.<br><br> Pro Tip<br><br> On the fence about purging certain memorabilia items? Take a photo. Back up that photo. Let go of the item(s). And parents, listen up: there are apps that can take the worry and stress out of &#x201c;How much of my kid&#x2019;s artwork do I keep?!&#x201d; Check out the resource list on page 173.<br><br> Everything you touched should now be in a labeled bin or pile. In chapter 2, we&#x2019;ll take the next imperative steps: getting rid of all the stuff you&#x2019;re ready to part with and deciding on new homes for your beloved Keepers.<br><br> Decluttering time should end with: delivering items that belong in Other Rooms, reassessing the Maybes, bringing donations out to the car (or close to the front door if you live car-�free), and taking the trash out to the curb.<br><br> Okay. Now forget everything you just learned.<br><br> You don&#x2019;t actually need any of these guidelines to make a real change. Walk around your space with the goal of getting rid of ten things. Stick &#x2019;em in a bag and then go donate, trash, or recycle them. It can be that easy.</p><h2>The Dollmaker of Krakow</h2><p><b>In the vein of <i>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</i> and <i>Number the Stars,</i> this fusion of fairy tales, folklore, and World War II history eloquently illustrates the power of love and the inherent will to survive even in the darkest of times.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In the land of dolls, there is magic.<br>In the land of humans, there is war.<br>Everywhere there is pain.<br>But <i>together</i> there is hope.<br>&nbsp;<br>Karolina is a living doll whose king and queen have been overthrown.

ROMERO lives with her family and a menagerie of pets in Colorado.&nbsp;<i>The Dollmaker of Krak�w</i> is her debut middle-grade novel.&nbsp;You can visit her online at RMRomero.com.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Dollmaker</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Karolina awoke in her new world with a glass heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It felt as if both roses and their thorns grew within that heart, for it held all the happiness and sorrow she had ever experienced in the Land of the Dolls. When she moved, it rattled against the glossy wood of the panel in her chest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trembling, Karolina raised a hand to her face. It took only a single touch for her to realize that the crack that had raced up her cheek in the Land of the Dolls was gone. When she lowered her arm, her fingers were smudged with blush-pink paint that smelled fresh. The kind wind had told her that someone in this human world had called out to her. So that person--whoever it was--must have been the one who had fixed her face and placed the glass heart inside her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Karolina glanced around and realized that she had been set on top of a high table amid wood shavings and coils of ribbon. While she was not made of glass or porcelain, as some of her friends had been, she did not want to fall from her perch, so she stayed very still to avoid losing her balance. To her right was a huge shape like a mountain, though it was not as a big as the ones in her country. A long, rough cloth had been draped over it. Karolina could not imagine what could be underneath it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Across from the table, a large window looked out into the darkness, which was broken only by the faint yellow glow of streetlamps. They were not made of peppermint sticks, as the ones in the Land of the Dolls had been, but instead rose like dark, sturdy trees from the cobblestones. The world outside did not look inviting, but the room around her reminded Karolina of her cottage: warm and friendly. However, this shop--for it was a shop, she realized--was not full of ball gowns and jackets and scarves, as her cottage had been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was full of toys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was row upon row of rocking horses whose flanks had been painted with daisy chains and autumn leaves. There were plush animals of many different shapes and sizes on the shelves, their tiny thread mouths smiling. And best of all, there were dolls everywhere. None of them had scratched faces or limbs scorched by fire. They all seemed at peace, ready to love and be loved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These other toys weren&#x2019;t like Karolina, though. She did not see any of them walking along their shelves, and none of them greeted her. They weren&#x2019;t alive and had no hearts of their own, and Karolina knew as well as any doll that only a creature who possessed a heart could be truly alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Karolina envied the silent toys a little; her glass heart had filled with gray dread. She was so alone, but if the kind wind was to believed, someone was waiting for her. Where was this person?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The clatter of approaching footsteps made Karolina go rigid. A door at the back of the shop opened, and a man appeared. He had a red beard, as if the Morning Star had briefly touched it with her fingertips, and wore a pair of white pajamas. He rubbed his green eyes as he walked toward her, limping. Now that he was closer, Karolina saw that the stranger was neither a little boy nor an old man, but somewhere in between. Still, Karolina imagined that if he picked her up, she would stand only a little taller than his hand, which was speckled with the same pink paint that now coated Karolina&#x2019;s fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He must be the person the wind had told her about, the one who had repaired her face and given her a new heart!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The man--the Dollmaker--sat down on the stool beside Karolina, wringing his hands. She could see that his face was streaked with tears that looked fresh. They had turned the pale skin of his cheeks as red and angry as battle cries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The Great War was twenty years ago,&#x201d; the Dollmaker said to himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s 1939. I&#x2019;m home in Krak�w. I&#x2019;m home. The nightmares aren&#x2019;t real.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It hadn&#x2019;t occurred to Karolina that there would be war in the human world too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the Dollmaker had been another toy, the right words to comfort him might have come to her, but she could not think of anything to say. He was so different from anyone Karolina had ever seen. Being able to show one&#x2019;s pain with tears so openly seemed to her like a terrible magic trick, one that humans performed almost without knowing it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His hands trembling, the Dollmaker removed the cloth from the mountain--revealing that it was no mountain at all. It was a grand dollhouse that stood three stories tall, the perfect size for Karolina. Her head would not scrape its ceilings, nor would she have to strain to reach the kitchen table or to open the wardrobe she saw in the high attic bedroom. The flower boxes in each window overflowed with cloth roses, and a sleek black cat sat on the railing of the second-floor balcony. Karolina particularly liked this touch; the cat would gobble up any rats who strayed near.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Dollmaker set to work putting the finishing touches on the roof&#x2019;s trim using a slim knife. His hand moved so quickly that it was as if he could not have stopped even if he had wanted to. He carved a delicate, wavy design that was so smooth it reminded Karolina of cake frosting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he worked, the Dollmaker&#x2019;s tears stopped, and Karolina thought she understood why. Creating something always made her feel better. It was only when her hands were still that she could not fend off the fears that threatened to overtake her heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As she watched the Dollmaker, Karolina breathed in deeply. This world, this place . . . It smelled familiar, like dust and cinnamon and fields of yellow flowers. Had she been here before? There was no precise way to describe the strange feeling that had stolen over her, cutting her as deeply as the Dollmaker&#x2019;s knife would. But the more Karolina tried to grasp at that feeling, the more she felt that she was trying to catch a dream between her small hands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe the Dollmaker would be able to answer her questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Karolina took a step toward the dollhouse, trying to think of what to say. But in her haste, she tripped over the hem of her long red skirts and gasped loudly. Her arms wheeled at her sides as she struggled to regain her footing. She managed to right herself before she could tumble over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was not how she&#x2019;d wanted to introduce herself, but it was too late to do anything else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; Karolina said, and waved. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Karolina.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Dollmaker dropped the knife, and his face turned whiter than smoke. &#x201c;Oh no. It&#x2019;s finally happened,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve finally lost my mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Karolina knew that the Dollmaker hadn&#x2019;t lost his mind. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with you,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Dollmaker sprang from his stool, backing away. &#x201c;But . . . but dolls can&#x2019;t talk. You can&#x2019;t be real. I must be tired--I&#x2019;m seeing things.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You do look tired, but I promise, I&#x2019;m just as real as you are,&#x201d; said Karolina. In truth, it was almost as if the Dollmaker was the strange one, the sole human in the world of the toys, and she, simply a natural extension of the shop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I made you,&#x201d; the Dollmaker said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t make something that comes to life.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Gardeners do it all the time with flowers,&#x201d; said Karolina. &#x201c;And you didn&#x2019;t really make me. My soul already existed--you just called out to me, and the wind brought me to you. I thought you already knew that. You did make me this body, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but I don&#x2019;t remember calling to anyone. I was trying to re-create a doll my mother had made, and . . .&#x201d; The Dollmaker shook his head rapidly. &#x201c;Oh, why am I talking to a figment of my imagination? This is all too much.&#x201d; He slumped against the side of the table, the movement causing the hem of his pajama pants to hike up several inches. Karolina saw that his leg was made from the same pale wood she had been carved from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think humans could be made out of wood,&#x201d; said Karolina, cocking her head to the side so that she could study the Dollmaker&#x2019;s leg from a different angle. He seemed so flustered that she thought he might not respond. But after a long moment filled only with the weighty ticking of a nearby clock, he did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Only this leg is made of wood,&#x201d; the Dollmaker said. &#x201c;The rest of me is made of something a bit softer.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I see your leg?&#x201d; Karolina said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Dollmaker averted his gaze. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t very . . . pretty,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Most people don&#x2019;t like to look at it for long.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; asked Karolina.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;People don&#x2019;t like seeing broken things,&#x201d; the Dollmaker said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not broken,&#x201d; said Karolina, planting her hands on her hips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m made of all wood, and you don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m broken, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No one has ever put it like that before,&#x201d; said the Dollmaker. He rolled his pants up to reveal four straps holding a wooden leg to what remained of his original leg, which was encased in a leather slip.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, things weren&#x2019;t as different here as Karolina had originally feared. &#x201c;I like your leg,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re one of the few who do,&#x201d; said the Dollmaker. Then he asked, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re . . . you&#x2019;re not someone who was turned into a doll, are you? You&#x2019;re actually a living doll?&#x201d; His hair had fallen over his temples, partially obscuring his eyes, and now he pushed it back impatiently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I would remember being human,&#x201d; Karolina said. &#x201c;But I only remember being a doll.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; the Dollmaker said softly. He sat back down on his stool and leaned forward, as if he intended to snatch every one of Karolina&#x2019;s words with his callused hands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing that he was growing more comfortable with her, Karolina said, &#x201c;You said your mother made a doll like me. What did you mean by that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother loved making things. She made a doll that looked just like you and told me that one day, I should give it to my own child. When my mother died after the war, I looked for that doll, but I never could find her. So I tried to remake her.&#x201d; The Dollmaker&#x2019;s voice gave way to a pause that somehow seemed louder than any word he had spoken yet. Then he said, &#x201c;And I made you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Had Karolina known the Dollmaker&#x2019;s mother? Was that why everything here felt so familiar? &#x201c;Is that why you make toys? Because your mother did?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;In a way. It only started when I couldn&#x2019;t sleep in the field hospital after I lost my leg.&#x201d; The Dollmaker patted his knee. &#x201c;It gave me something to do when everyone else was asleep. It still does. My dreams can be . . . unsettling. Wars are hard to forget.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I have dreams like that too,&#x201d; said Karolina. &#x201c;Sometimes I close my eyes and I see every awful thing that happened in the Land of the Dolls.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The Land of the Dolls?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s where I used to live before you called to me and I came here,&#x201d; Karolina explained. &#x201c;Just like you live in . . .&#x201d; She tapped her chin, considering. Had the Dollmaker mentioned exactly where this was?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Krak�w,&#x201d; the Dollmaker told her. &#x201c;This is the city of Krak�w in the Republic of Poland.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Krak�w.&#x201d; The city&#x2019;s name felt fresh and crisp on Karolina&#x2019;s tongue like an apple slice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it like? It is a good place?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe so. I love it here very much.&#x201d; The Dollmaker motioned toward the window. &#x201c;I made a model of the city, if you&#x2019;d like to see it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Karolina bounced from one boot-clad foot to the other. &#x201c;Yes, please,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Dollmaker went to pick her up, then stopped, his hands hovering above her. &#x201c;May I move you?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be rude by carrying you if you don&#x2019;t want me to.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind being carried. Your legs are so much longer than mine. It would take me forever to walk across the room,&#x201d; said Karolina. She raised her arms, and the Dollmaker took her off the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he walked over to the window, Karolina caught a glimpse of her reflection in the glass pane and a little more of her anxiety left her. The Dollmaker had captured her likeness perfectly: she had the same golden hair and large cornflower-blue eyes she&#x2019;d possessed in the Land of the Dolls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You did a very good job making me,&#x201d; Karolina told the Dollmaker. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; the Dollmaker said. He seemed eager to move past the subject, however, and pointed downward. &#x201c;This is Little Krak�w.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The model of the Dollmaker&#x2019;s city had been placed in the shop window. A building with two golden towers and a huge statue of a stern-faced man stood in its center. Pigeons and people gathered around it in equal numbers, while small figures made their way toward the stocky houses and shops surrounding the square. The Dollmaker himself was part of the little Krak�w, standing in front of his shop with a doll in one hand and a cane in the other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was the two figures in the corner--a young knight with a golden sword, and the dragon slinking toward him--that took Karolina&#x2019;s breath away, however.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The knight--where does he live?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Prince Krakus&#x2019;s, and his home was the Wawel Castle,&#x201d; the Dollmaker said. He tapped a small building whose facade had been painted to resemble red bricks. A blue river curled around it like a cat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I want to meet him,&#x201d; said Karolina. &#x201c;How long would it take me to get there? It doesn&#x2019;t look too far away.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The real Krak�w is a bit . . . bigger than the parts of it I put in the model. I&#x2019;m afraid it would take you a very long time to walk to Wawel Castle,&#x201d; said the Dollmaker. &#x201c;And I hate to disappoint you, but the prince and the dragon are part of Krak�w&#x2019;s history, not its present. I only put them in the model because I liked their story so much.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The news broke over Karolina like a gust of winter wind, chilly and unwelcome. &#x201c;If the knight doesn&#x2019;t protect the people in this city, who does?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said the Dollmaker, &#x201c;right now, we have an army and a navy who can help us. But I&#x2019;m afraid for my country. There are storm clouds gathering around us.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking of the soldiers in their brilliant silver uniforms who had served the queen, Karolina said, &#x201c;But armies don&#x2019;t always win the battles they fight. I thought this world would be safe.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Restless World: Portrait of an Era</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A History of the World in 100 Objects </i>brings the world of Shakespeare and the Tudor era of Elizabeth I into focus</b><br><br>We feel we know Shakespeare&#x2019;s characters.

Originally printed in 1989 each edition has added updates of events predicted by Nostradamus that have occurred since the last edition. For this newest edition regressionist and psychic researcher Dolores Cannon has written an extensive addendum that covers evidence of the fulfillment of the prophecies predicted by Nostradamus. Secret weapons computers the World Wide Web and the New Science of Nanotechnology are included among the new topics covered. Nostradamus broke through to our time period by a one-in-a-million chance contact through hypnosis. In this series the master himself explains the puzzles he carefully concealed in code within his famous quatrains or prophecies. Volume One contains 136 quatrains. <i>--This text refers to the paperback edition of this title</i></p><p>Dolores Cannon is a past-life regressionist and hypnotherapist who specializes in the recovery and cataloging of 'Lost Knowledge'. Her roots in hypnosis go back to the 1960s. She has been specializing in past-life therapy since 1979. Dolores has become, perhaps, the world's most unlikely expert on the prophecies of Nostradamus. A retired Navy wife from Huntsville, AR, USA, Dolores was nearly fifty years old when she began experimenting with hypnosis and past-life regression. The results were, to say the least, quite spectacular! Working through several different subjects, Dolores was able to establish communication with the living Michel De Notredame, better known as the prophet, Nostradamus. His revelations and their impact on our own time are both fascinating and at times frightening. Dolores has written the three volume set 'Conversations With Nostradamus,' the series on the translation of Nostradamus' quatrains. This series contains the translation of almost 1000 prophecies, all interpreted for the first time and have been in print since 1989. It is considered the most accurate interpretation of the prophecies ever printed.During the past eighteen years Dolores has been a UFO investigator, using her skills as a regressionist to help people that been involved in abduction cases. She has written several books on the UFO information volunteers have revealed while under hypnosis.Dolores is now teaching her unique technique of hypnosis all over the world.In addition to the three volumes of 'Conversations With Nostradamus,' Dolores has completed: 'The Legend of Starcrash,' 'Keepers of the Garden,' 'Legacy from the Stars,' 'A Soul Remembers Hiroshima,' 'They Walked With Jesus,' 'Jesus and the Essenes' and 'Between Death and Life&amp;.'

In this increasingly hardscrabble environment, it is absolutely imperative that the boards of these organizations function as energetically, creatively, and efficiently as possible. Michael M. Kaiser&#x2019;s personal history with boards of arts organizations began when he served on the board of the Washington Opera (now the Washington National Opera) in 1983. Today, in his capacity as president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Kaiser recently completed a 50-state, 69-city Arts in Crisis tour. Board issues came up repeatedly as central to the success or failure of the organization. Drawing on these and many other conversations, nationally and internationally, Kaiser&#x2019;s book offers members of boards and staffs the information they need to create the healthy atmosphere necessary to thriving arts organizations. Organized in a clear, readable, question-and-answer format, Leading Roles covers every aspect of board participation in the life of the organization, including mission and governance; fundraising and marketing responsibilities; the relationship of the board to the artistic director, executive director, and staff; and its responsibilities for planning and budgeting. Kaiser addresses boards in crisis, international boards, and boards of arts organizations of color. Throughout, he emphasizes the importance of transparency and clarity in the board&#x2019;s dealings with its own members and those of the arts community of which it is a part, showing how anything less results in contentiousness that can immobilize an arts organization, or even tear it apart.</p><p>MICHAEL M. KAISER is the author of The Art of the Turnaround: Creating and Maintaining Healthy Arts Organizations. He is a graduate of Brandeis University, class of 1975."The musicians of ICSOM must continue to be our own positive advocates in a managerial climate that is resistant to a positive message. Mr. Kaiser's new book is a powerful tool that can assist us in articulating our vision."--Senza Sordino "International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians newsletter"<br><br>"Leading Roles is a rich yet tidy cornucopia of solutions for the challenges facing the American arts scene . . . The author is compelling as he scopes the horizon, sizing up a future in which global cooperation will loom large for the arts."-- "Washington Post"<br><br>"Although aimed at associations in the arts - dance, opera, theatre - the book Kaiser has written should be must-reading for every board member and staff executive of every association. Leading Roles addresses every aspect of board participation in the life of an association, including mission and governance; fundraising and marketing; the relationship of the board to the artistic director, executive director, and staff; and board responsibilities for planning and budgeting."--Senza Sordino "The Examiner, Washington, DC"</p><h2>I Want You Back (The Want You Series)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Lorelei James kicks-off her Want You Series with a Lund family cousin hot enough to melt the ice and mend a broken heart.</b><br><br>Former NHL star Jaxson Lund has returned to the Twin Cities, but he's at loose ends, unsure if he belongs at Lund Industries, or where he stands with Lucy, his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter, Mimi.

It's not that Lucy doesn't trust Jax...she's just unconvinced he can handle multiple responsibilities when he's been singularly focused on playing hockey. But when issues arise with Mimi, Lucy's shocked at how levelheaded and paternal he acts, giving her a glimpse of the Jax she used to know, the sexy, sweet man she fell for years ago.<br><br>Once Lucy lets her guard down, Jax goes all in to show her how good they are together, but will their past remain too large an obstacle to ever overcome?</p><p><b>Lorelei James</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of the Need You Series, the Blacktop Cowboys series, and the Mastered series.

What time will Daddy get here?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever the hell he feels like it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not an answer I could give my precocious eight-year-old daughter, even when it was the truth. "He said after six. Since it's now six fifteen, he'll be here at any moment."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mimi sighed heavily. Then she kicked her legs up and hung upside down from the back of the chair, balancing on her hands. It was obvious to everyone she inherited her natural athleticism from her father. Embarrassingly I was one of those people who trip over their own feet . . . and everyone else's.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You sure that hanging like a monkey in a tree won't upset your stomach?" I asked her. "Or give you a headache? I'd hate for you to miss an overnight with your dad."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I have to practice so being upside down doesn't make me sick," she replied with another sigh, as if I should've already known that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ah. So what are you practicing for this week?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's between a trapeze artist or an ice skater. If I decide to have a partner I'll have to be used to being upside down."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last month Mimi wanted to be an astronaut. The month before that a dolphin trainer. While I've always told her that she can be whatever she wants to be when she grows up, it's exhausting finding an activity that holds her attention. After spending money on dance lessons, gymnastics classes, martial arts classes, T-ball, soccer club, fencing, swim team, tennis lessons, golf lessons and horseback riding lessons, I'd put my foot down and said no new organized activities. If none of those worked then she needed to wait until she was older to try others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I feared she'd play the guilt card and I'd find myself buying tickets to the circus, a Cirque du Soleil show or a Disney on Ice program. Or . . . maybe . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sure your dad would love to take you to a performance." Not really dirty pool-Mimi's father, Jaxson Lund, was a member of the billionaire Lund family as well as a highly paid former pro hockey player, so money had never been an issue for him. And there was nothing he loved more than humoring Mimi's requests, even if it was to alleviate the guilt that he'd missed being a regular presence in her life for most of her life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The doorbell pealed and Mimi squealed, "I'll get it!" twisting her lithe little body sideways from the chair to land lightly on her feet, agile as a cat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I heard her disengage the locks and yell, "Daddy! I thought you'd never get here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He laughed. That sweet indulgent laugh he only had for our daughter. "I missed you too, Mimi."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I got my stuff all packed. I'm ready to go now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without saying good-bye to me? That stung. But I sucked it up and started toward the entryway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure. Just let me get the all clear from your mom first."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then Jaxson Lund and I nearly collided as we turned the corner simultaneously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His big hands circled my upper arms to steady me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had to tilt my head back to look at him as he towered over me by almost a foot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was unfair that my ex actually looked better now than he did when he and I met a decade ago. His dark hair was shorter-no more long locks befitting the bad-boy defenseman of the NHL. No scruffy beard, just the smooth skin of his outlandishly square jaw and muscled neck. His eyes were clear, not bloodshot as I'd usually seen them, making those turquoise-hued eyes the most striking feature on his face . . . Besides that damn smile. Hockey players were supposed to have teeth missing from taking a puck or two hundred to the face. I knew Jax had a partial, but he'd never removed it when we were together. The lips framing that smile were both soft and hard. Druggingly warm and soft when pressed into a kiss, but cold and hard when twisting into a cruel sneer. A sneer I'd been on the receiving end of many times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That shook me out of my musings about Jax's amazing physical attributes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey, Luce."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jax had called me Luce from the first-a joke between us because I warned him I wasn't loose and wouldn't sleep with him on the first date. An inside joke made me feel special-he made me feel special-until I realized Jaxson Lund used that killer smile and those gorgeous twinkling eyes as a weapon on every woman he wanted to bang the boards with; there wasn't anything special about me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I forced a smile. "Jaxson. How are you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He retreated at my cool demeanor and dropped his hands. "I'm fine. You're looking well."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And people thought we couldn't be civil to each other. "Thanks. You too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Anything I should know before Meems and I take off?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meems. He'd given our daughter another nickname, even when Mimi was already the shortened version of Milora Michelle. "Nothing worth mentioning. She's been looking forward to this all week."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those beautiful eyes narrowed. "So don't disappoint her, right?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Right."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Luce. I'm not-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Daddy, come on. Are we goin' or what?" Mimi demanded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We're goin', impatient one." Jaxson hauled her up and cocked her on his hip with seemingly little effort, because his eyes never left mine. "We can do the switch back at the Lund Industries thing on Sunday afternoon?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You'll be there?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I work there, remember?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the past six months since Jax had joined the family business, I'd hardly seen him hustling around the building in a suit and tie, so I had no idea what his actual job title was. As far as I could tell, he didn't "work" there like I did. Sunday's event was a retirement party for a woman I doubted he knew personally. "I'm surprised. I wasn't aware that you knew Lola."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The poor woman was tasked with getting me up to speed on all departments when I started at LI. I'd still be aimlessly wandering the halls if not for her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Lola will be missed, that's for sure. So if you want to bring Mimi's things on Sunday, that'll work. I planned on going for the two hours."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sounds like a plan. Speaking of . . . what are your plans for the weekend?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>None of your business. "Oh, this and that. Mimi has more things planned for you two than you could fit into two weeks, say nothing of two days."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His dark eyebrow winged up. "Now I'm taking that as a personal challenge."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mimi held her arms out for a hug. "Bye, Mommy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bye, wild one. Behave, okay?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Promise to call me tomorrow sometime."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She sighed heavily. "I'd call you all the time if I had my own cell phone."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I chuckled. "Nice try. Use Daddy's phone. Or Grandma Edie's."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But all of my friends have iPhones."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Eight-year-olds do not need a cell phone." I sent Jaxson a stern look as a reminder not to swoop in and buy her one just because he could. Then I kissed her cheek. "Love you, Mimi."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Love you too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jaxson gathered Mimi's stuff with her chattering away at him like she always did. I wondered how much of it he paid attention to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not my concern. I'd had to learn to let go of a lot of my issues with Jaxson's parenting style since he'd returned permanently to Minneapolis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I waved good-bye and locked the door behind them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I readied myself for my first date with Damon, my thoughts scrolled back to the first time I�d met Jaxson Lund a decade ago . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'd left work early to take my mother to the doctor. After I'd dropped her off at her place, I pulled into one of those super fancy deluxe car washes that offered one-hour detailing inside and out. Winter in the Twin Cities meant tons of road salt and freeway grime, and my poor car needed TLC. Not that my Toyota Corolla was anything fancy, but it'd been a major purchase for me after I'd graduated from college. My first new car, and I took good care of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With an hour to kill, I grabbed a magazine and a Diet Mountain Dew. The lobby wasn't jam-packed with other customers-which was a total contradiction to the lines of cars outside-but I embraced the quiet for a change and settled in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My alone time lasted about five minutes. A guy blew in-the wind was blustery, but not nearly as blustering as the man yakking on his cell phone at a thousand decibels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Peter. I told you I'm happy to stay at the same salary." Pause. "Why? Because a salary freeze for a year isn't the end of the world for me. Especially if that means they can use that extra money to lure the kind of D-man we need."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rolled my eyes and wished I'd brought my earbuds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No. What it speaks to isn't that I'm not worth more money. It shows that I'm a team player."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I tried to ignore the annoying man. But he paced in front of me, forcing me to listen to him as well as watch his jean-clad legs nearly brush my knees as his hiking boots beat a path in the carpet. From the reflection in the glass that allowed customers to see their cars going through the automated portion of the car wash, I knew he was a big man; tall, at least six foot four, with wide shoulders, long arms and long legs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And huge lungs, because his voice continued to escalate. His pace increased. He gestured wildly with the hand not holding the phone. He couldn't see me scowling at him, as his head was down and his baseball cap put his face in shadow. Not that he'd looked my way even one time to see if his loud, one-sided conversation might be bothering me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Look at me, look at me! My job is so crucial that I can't even go to the car wash without dealing with such pressing matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ugh. I hated when people acted inconsiderate and self-important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stopped moving. "Fine. It's stupid as shit, but an increase of one dollar if it'll make you happy to have on record that my salary went up again this year. I'll let you keep one hundred percent of that dollar instead of your usual twenty percent commission." Pause. "Do you hear me laughing? Look. I'm done with this convo, Peter. Call me after the trade is over. Bye."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I flipped through a couple of pages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He sighed and shoved his phone in his back pocket. Then I sensed him taking in his surroundings for the first time. The lack of customers, no car going through the car wash to entertain him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please don't assume I'll entertain you. He was definitely that type of guy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I silently willed him to go away. But I'll be damned if the man didn't plop down on the bench directly across from me. I felt his gaze moving up my legs from my heeled suede boots to where the hem of my wool skirt ended above my knees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing to ignore him, I thumbed another magazine page and took a swig of my soda.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ever have one of those days?" he asked me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The smart response would've been no response. I'm not sure what compelled me to say, "One of those days where you're enjoying a rare moment of quiet and some rude guy destroys it with an obnoxiously loud phone conversation? Why yes, ironically enough, I am having one of those days right now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then he laughed. A deep rumble of amusement that had me glancing up at him against my better judgment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our eyes met.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Holy hell was this man gorgeous. Like male model gorgeous with amazing bone structure and aquamarine-colored eyes. And his smile. Just wry enough to be compelling and "aw shucks" enough to be charming and wicked enough that I had a hard time not smiling back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry. I don't normally carry on like that, but he was seriously missing my point."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So I gathered." Dammit. I'd confessed I'd been listening in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He leaned in, resting his forearms on his knees. "I'm serious. I'm not that annoying cell phone guy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe not normally, but you were today."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You don't pull any punches, do you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No. Also now you've moved on from being 'annoying cell phone guy' to annoying guy determined to convince me that he's not annoying cell phone guy . . . which is even more annoying."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His grin widened. "I'm supposed to apologize for that too? Okay. Sorry for interrupting your quality time reading"-he snatched the magazine off my lap-"Redbook and this article on how to prioritize organization in day-to-day life."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My cheeks flamed even as I scooted forward to snatch back my magazine. "Gimme that."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"After you answer two questions. First, are you married, engaged or currently involved with someone? And if the answer is no, will you go out on a date with me so I can prove that I'm not annoying?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I laughed. "I actually believed you couldn't get more annoying, but I was wrong."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you single?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Annoying and tenacious-there's a winning combo," I retorted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And she hedges yet again. Fine. Don't answer. I'll just read this fascinating article that's got you so engrossed you can't even answer a simple question."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Gimme back my magazine."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He lifted a brow. "I doubt it's your magazine. I'll bet you took it from the stack over there that's for customers to share."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Fine. Keep it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Let's start over." He tossed the magazine aside and offered his hand. "I'm Jaxson. What's your name, beautiful?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Calling me beautiful threw me off. I automatically answered, "Lucy," and took his hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Lucy. Lovely name. Please put me out of my misery, Lovely Lucy, and tell me that you're single."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm single but I'm not interested in flirting with you because you're bored at the car wash and I'm convenient."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He flashed me a grin that might've made me weak kneed had I been standing. "I'm far from bored. Let me prove it by taking you out for dinner. I promise I'll be on my least-annoying behavior."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's when I realized he still held my hand. That's also when I realized I was a sucker for his tenacious charm, because I said, "Okay. But if that cell phone comes out even one time I will snatch it from you and grind it under my boot heel as I'm walking away."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'd expect nothing less."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I tugged my hand free before he did something else completely charming like kiss my knuckles. "Are you single?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, ma'am. And this is the first time I've asked a woman I met at a car wash for a date."</p></p><h2>Veganize It!: Easy DIY Recipes for a Plant-Based Kitchen</h2><p><b>Vegan pantry staples plus enticing recipes in which to use them</b><br><br> This is the ultimate DIY pantry book, doing double duty with recipes for vegan staples, plus ideas on &nbsp;how to use them as building blocks in both new and classic recipes.

He took in a deep breath, flooding his already-infested lungs with more toxic dust. He didn&#x2019;t even notice or care anymore. Right then, the mid-morning break was all he was thinking of, given that his working day had started at five. </p><p>As the last echoes of the whistle died out around him and with the army of pickaxes now at rest, Maxim heard the distant sound of the Miass River, out by the mouth of the open mine. It reminded him of when he was a boy, when his uncle often took him swimming at a se�cluded spot on the outskirts of Ozyorsk, away from the thick, putrid smoke that belched out of the smelting plant twenty-four hours a day. </p><p>He remembered the smell of the pine trees, so tall they seemed to touch the sky. He missed the tranquility of the place. </p><p>He missed the open sky and the clean air even more. </p><p>A voice rang out from farther down the tunnel. &#x201c;Hey, Mamo, get your ass over here. We&#x2019;re playing for a go on Pyotr&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d; </p><p>Maxim wanted to roll his eyes at Vasily, partly for the diminutive, which he hated, and partly for the man&#x2019;s general stupidity, but the wiry bastard took offense at the slightest provocation, so Maxim smiled at the group of men instead, hefted his pickax onto a broad, muscle-bound shoulder, and sauntered over to where the three other mudaks were al�ready at their regular seats. </p><p>He sat down next to the unfortunate Pyotr and set his tool against the wall beside him. Maxim had laid eyes on the man&#x2019;s daughter only once, and though she was indeed strikingly beautiful, he had no doubt that she could certainly do a lot better than any of the pathetic losers around him toiling deep in the bowels of the earth for a less-than-meager wage. </p><p>Maxim fished out a small flask&#x2014;punishable offense&#x2014;and took a long swig, then wiped his mouth with a grimy sleeve. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s play, then,&#x201d; he told Vasily. He might as well try to win some money from the leering idiot if he could. </p><p>Stanislav, the most pathetic of the foursome, went first, followed by Pyotr, then Maxim. Then Vasily&#x2019;s turn came around. He slammed his fist down onto a just-turned Queen of Hearts, rattling the half-broken wooden table around which the four men sat, then leaned back with a smug smile on his face. </p><p>Maxim didn&#x2019;t flinch. His mind was already drifting away. He felt another odd tingling in his head, like a little tickle really, deep in his brain. For some reason, he thought of how much he hated Ochko. Ev�eryone pretended it was about skill when really luck was all you needed. He much preferred Durak, a game that seemed to be about luck, but was really about skill. He had never once been the last to hold cards in twenty-seven years of playing that game. It was probably why that leech Vasily refused to play the game with him. </p><p>Vasily&#x2019;s croaky voice broke through his curdled thoughts. &#x201c;Come on, Mamo, deal yourself a card before we all turn to stone.&#x201d; </p><p>Maxim looked down and realized he had turned over his first two cards without even looking at them. </p><p>Stanislav turned a Seven of Clubs, unsurprisingly cutting him out of the game after three cards. Pyotr turned a Two of Spades, giving himself nineteen. He looked nervously at Vasily, whose expression didn&#x2019;t change. </p><p>The bastard was leading with eighteen. That, and he was a very bad loser. Vasily gestured at Maxim to hurry up and take his turn, presum�ably so he could turn a Three and win the small pile of coins sitting in the middle of the table. </p><p>Maxim really didn&#x2019;t want to let him win. Not that day. Not there, not then. And as he was about to turn his card, he felt a piercing sensation worm its way through the back of his skull. It didn&#x2019;t last for more than a breath. He shook his head, shut his eyes, then opened them again. Whatever it was, it had gone. </p><p>He peeked at his card, then looked up at Vasily. The wiry creep was leering at him and right then, Maxim knew that the man was cheating. He didn&#x2019;t know why, but he was dead sure of it. </p><p>Not only cheating, but looking at him like&#x2014;like he hated him. More than hated. Loathed. Despised. </p><p>Like he wanted to kill him. </p><p>And right then, Maxim realized that he loathed Vasily even more. His veins throbbing angrily against his skull, he managed to turn over his card. He watched as Vasily dropped his eyes to take it in. It was a Five of Diamonds. Maxim was also out. Vasily smirked at him and turned his own card. A Four of Hearts. Too many. He had won. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s us, moi lyubimye,&#x201d; Vasily said, all smug and reaching out to gather his winnings. &#x201c;Four hearts, beating as one.&#x201d; </p><p>Maxim&#x2019;s hand shot out to block Vasily, but just as he did, Stanislav turned away from the table and convulsed before throwing up, spewing the contents of his belly onto the cheat&#x2019;s boots. </p><p>&#x201c;Fuu! Stanislav, you son of a whore&#x2014;&#x201d; Vasily lurched back from the retching man, then a pained look spread across his face and he fell off the wooden crate on which he had been sitting and hit the ground, clutching his head, knocking over the table and sending the cards flying off. </p><p>Pyotr shot to his feet too, flaring with indignation. &#x201c;Four? What four? I didn&#x2019;t see a four. You filthy cheat.&#x201d; </p><p>Maxim swung his gaze back at Stanislav, whose eyes were bloodshot, as if the force of his retching had blown all the blood vessels in his face, and Maxim knew, knew for sure, that Stanislav had also been cheating. </p><p>They all had, the swine. They were going to fleece him&#x2014;then they were going to hurt him. </p><p>As if to confirm it, Vasily started to laugh. Not just a laugh, a de�monic, deep-rooted laugh that gushed with contempt and mockery and&#x2014;Maxim was sure of it&#x2014;hatred. </p><p>Maxim stared at him, rooted to the mine&#x2019;s soil, feeling the sweat seep out of him, unsure of what to do&#x2014;</p><p>He saw Vasily take a step in his direction&#x2014;e really didn&#x2019;t look at all well&#x2014;hen the cheat&#x2019;s eyes went wild and the man stopped in his tracks. </p><p>Pyotr had just embedded Maxim&#x2019;s hack into the side of Vasily&#x2019;s head. </p><p>Maxim lurched back as Vasily hit the ground at his feet, a fountain of blood gushing out of the man&#x2019;s skull. Then he was aware that the pain in the back of his head was back, sharper than before. An intense fear washed over him. He would be next. He was sure of it. </p><p>They were going to kill him unless he killed them first. </p><p>He&#x2019;d never been as sure of anything in his entire life. </p><p>Angry yells erupted from other recesses of the mine as he launched himself at Pyotr, blocking his arm while grabbing the hack and fighting the murderous cheat for it. In the dim light of the lone grimy lantern, he glimpsed Stanislav, back on his feet, going for his pickax too. Everything turned into a blur of claws and swings and shouts and punches until Maxim felt something warm in his hands, something he was absolutely compelled to squeeze until his hands met each other in the middle, and when clarity returned to his eyes, he saw poor Pyotr&#x2019;s eyeless, bloodied face turn a livid purple as he snapped the man&#x2019;s neck. </p><p>All around him, the air was suddenly full of screaming and the sound of steel cleaving through flesh and bone. </p><p>Maxim smiled and sucked in a big lungful of air. He had never heard anything so beautiful&#x2014;hen something flashed in the corner of his vision. </p><p>He leaned backward as the ax came swinging toward his neck and felt the displaced air blow across his face. He jabbed a fist into his attacker&#x2019;s ribs, then another. Something crunched. He stepped behind the groan�ing man, swung an arm around his throat&#x2014;t was Popov, the shift manager, who had never even raised his voice the whole time that Maxim had worked there&#x2014;and began to choke him. </p><p>Popov dropped to the ground like a sack of beetroot. </p><p>Maxim grabbed the ax from the dead man&#x2019;s hand and immediately buried it in the face of Stanislav, who already had the hack he was hold�ing halfway through an arc toward Maxim&#x2019;s chest. Maxim tried to duck out of its path, but the hack still connected and gouged a large chunk out of his side. </p><p>Stanislav toppled backward and fell to the ground, the ax embedded in his face. </p><p>Maxim dropped to his knees, then keeled over, grabbing his torn flesh with both hands, trying to push the two sides of the wound back together. </p><p>He lay there, writhing on the ground, pain shooting through him, his hands bathed in his own blood, and glanced down the mineshaft. He could barely make out the dimly lit silhouettes of other mudaks up and down the tunnels, hacking away at one another furiously. </p><p>He looked down to the wound in his side. His blood was rippling through his fingers and cascading onto the thick grime of the mine floor. He kept staring at it as the death cries echoed around him and the minutes slipped by, his mind numb, his thoughts adrift in a maelstrom of confusion&#x2014;then a powerful explosion ripped through the air behind him. </p><p>The walls shook, and dust and rock shards rained down on him. </p><p>Three other explosions followed, knocking the lanterns off their mounts and plunging the already-dark tunnels of the mine into total darkness. </p><p>Everything went deathly silent for a brief moment&#x2014;hen came a cool breeze and an urgent, rushing sound. </p><p>A rush that turned into a roar. </p><p>Maxim stared into the darkness. He never saw the solid wall of water that plowed into him with the force of an anvil and whisked him away. But in those seconds of consciousness, in those last moments before the water overpowered his lungs and the force of the torrent slammed him against the tunnel wall, Maxim Nikolaev&#x2019;s final thoughts were of his boyhood and of how peaceful it would be to return to the river of his youth. </p><p>Standing by the detonator at the mouth of the tunnel, the man of science listened until all silence returned to the mountain. He was shak�ing visibly, though not from the cold. His companion, on the other hand, was unnaturally calm and serene. Which made the scientist shake even more. </p><p>They had made the long journey together, from the distant isolation of the Siberian monastery to this equally forsaken place. A journey that had started many years ago with the promise of great things, but that had since veered into savage, criminal territory. The man of science couldn&#x2019;t quite put his finger on how they&#x2019;d reached this point of no return, how it had all degenerated into mass murder. And as he stared at his companion, he feared there would be more to come. </p><p>&#x201c;What have we done?&#x201d; he muttered, fearful even as the words snuck past his lips. </p><p>His companion turned to face him. For a man of such power and influence, a man who had become an intimate friend and confidant of the tsar and tsarina, he was unusually dressed. An old, greasy jacket, tattered around the cuffs. Baggy trousers that hung low at the back, like the serouals worn by the Turks. A farmer&#x2019;s oiled boots. Then there was the wild, tangled beard, and the greasy hair, parted down the middle like that of a tavern waiter. The scientist knew it was all artifice, of course, all part of a calculated look. A craftily honed image for a grand master plan, one in which the man of science had become an enabler and an accom�plice. A costume designed to convey the humbleness and humility of a true man of God. An outfit so basic it also couldn&#x2019;t possibly detract from its wearer&#x2019;s hypnotic, gray-blue gaze. </p><p>The gaze of a demon. </p><p>&#x201c;What have we done?&#x201d; his companion replied in his odd, simple, almost primordial manner of speech. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you what we&#x2019;ve done, my friend. You and me . . . we&#x2019;ve just ensured the salvation of our people.&#x201d; </p><p>As always happened in the other&#x2019;s company, the man of science felt a numbing weakness overcome him. All he could do was stand there and nod. But as he began to digest what they had just done, a stifling dark�ness descended upon him and he wondered about what horrors lay ahead, horrors he would have never imagined possible back in that se�cluded monastery, where he&#x2019;d first met the mysterious peasant. Where the man had brought him back from the edge, shown him the wonder of his gift, and talked to him about his wanderings among the hidden cloisters deep in the forests and the beliefs he had learned there. Where the mystic with the piercing eyes had first told him about the advent of &#x201c;true tsar,&#x201d; a fair ruler, a redeemer of the people born of the common folk. A savior of Holy Rus. </p><p>For the briefest moment, the man of science wondered if he&#x2019;d ever be able to extricate himself from his mentor&#x2019;s hold and avoid the mad�ness that surely lay ahead. But as quickly as the thought had surfaced, it was gone, snuffed out before it could even begin to take shape. </p><p>He&#x2019;d never seen anyone refuse anything of Grigory Efimovich Rasputin. </p><p>And he knew, with crippling certainty, that his will was far from strong enough for him to be the first. </p><p><b>1</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Queens, New York City</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Present Day</b></p><p>The vodka didn&#x2019;t taste like much, not anymore, and that last swig had scorched his throat like acid, but that didn&#x2019;t stop him from wanting more. </p><p>This was a bad day for Leo Sokolov. </p><p>A bad day coming close on the heels of many bad days. </p><p>He tore his eyes off the wall-mounted TV screen and gestured to the barman for a top-up, then returned his gaze to the live feed coming back from Moscow. Bitterness roiled inside him as the camera zoomed in on the coffin being lowered into the ground. </p><p>The last of us, he lamented in angry silence. The last . . . and the best. </p><p>The last of the family I wiped out. </p><p>The screen split to show another feed, this one coming from the city&#x2019;s Manezh Square, where thousands of protesters were angrily demonstrat�ing under the walls and spires of the Kremlin. Under the very noses of those who had murdered that brave, noble&#x2014;hat magnificent man. </p><p>You can scream and shout all you like, he fumed inwardly. What do they care? What they did to him they&#x2019;ll do again, and they&#x2019;ll keep doing it every time someone dares to speak out against them. They don&#x2019;t care how many they kill. To them, we&#x2019;re all just . . . He remembered the man&#x2019;s rousing words. </p><p>We&#x2019;re all just cattle. </p><p>A profound sadness seeped through him as the screen shifted to a close-up of the grieving widow, all in black, doing her best to appear dignified and defiant despite knowing, Sokolov was sure, that any linger�ing aspirations of protest would be relentlessly snuffed out of her. </p><p>Sokolov&#x2019;s fingers tightened against the glass. </p><p>Unlike other opposition leaders, the man they were burying hadn&#x2019;t been an egomaniac lusting for power, or a bored oligarch looking to add another trophy to his gilded life.

Music expert Dick Weissman opens with the dawn of American history, then moves to the book's key focus: 20th-century music &#x2013; songs by and about Native Americans, African-Americans, women, Spanish-speaking groups, and more. Unprecedented in its approach, the book offers a multidisciplinary discussion that is broad and diverse, and illuminates how social events impact music as well as how music impacts social events. Weissman delves deep, covering everything from current Native American music to &#x201c;music of hate&#x201d; &#x2013; racist and neo-Nazi music &#x2013; to the music of the Gulf wars, union songs, patriotic and antiwar songs, and beyond.

In The Pastor Has No Clothes, Jon Zens demonstrates that putting all the ecclesiastical eggs in the pastor&#39;s basket has no precedent in the New Testament. Using 1 Corinthians 12:14, Zens shows the usual way of doing church contradicts Paul&#39;s self-evident remark that &#34;the body indeed is not one part&#34; and then goes on to unfold from that Epistle how the living church functions &#34;with many parts.&#34; Jon dismembers the traditional pastor doctrine from various angles by combining two new essays and a response to Eugene Peterson&#39;s The Pastor: A Memoir, with three past articles and excerpts from his response to Dr. Ben Witherington&#39;s review of Pagan Christianity.</p><p></p><h2>Heart of the Artichoke and Other Kitchen Journeys</h2><p><b>Recipes from a very small kitchen by a man with a very large talent. </b><br><br>Nobody better embodies the present-day mantra "Eat real food in season" than David Tanis, one of the most original voices in American cooking. For more than a quarter-century, Tanis has been the chef at the groundbreaking Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, where the menu consists solely of a single perfect meal that changes each evening. Tanis&#x2019;s recipes are down-to-earth yet sophisticated, simple to prepare but impressive on the plate. <br><br>Tanis opens this soulful, fun-to-read cookbook with his own private food rituals, those treats&#x2015;jalape�o pancakes, beans on toast, pasta for one&#x2015;for when you are on your own in the kitchen with no one else to satisfy. Then he follows with twenty incomparable menus (five per season) that serve four to six. Each transports the reader to places far and wide.&nbsp; And for grand occasions, a time for the whole tribe to gather around the table, Tanis delivers festive menus for holiday feasts. So in one book, three kinds of cooking: small, medium, and large.</p><p><p>David Tanis&nbsp;has worked as a professional chef for over three decades, and is the author of several&nbsp;acclaimed cookbooks, including&nbsp;<i>A Platter of Figs and Other Recipes</i>, which was chosen as one of the 50 best cookbooks&nbsp;ever by the <i>Guardian/Observer</i> (U.K.) and <i>Heart of the Artichoke</i>, which was nominated for a James Beard Award. He spent many years as chef with Alice Waters at Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, California; he ran the kitchen of the&nbsp;highly praised Caf� Escalera in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and he operated a successful&nbsp;private supper club in&nbsp;his 17th-century&nbsp;walk-up&nbsp;in Paris. He has written for a number of&nbsp;publications, including the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>Guardian/Observer</i> (U.K.), <i>Cooking Light</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bon App�tit</i>, <i>Fine Cooking,</i> and <i>Saveur</i>. Tanis lives in Manhattan and has been writing the weekly City Kitchen column for the Food section of the <i>New York Times</i> for nearly six years.<br> &nbsp;</p>Starred Review. Tanis (A Platter of Figs) has been a chef at Berkeley's Chez Panisse for so long, he seems to have achieved a certain California Zen master state of being. A recipe is "what happens between the concept of a dish and its final result," he observes, then paints a fine line between "om" and "yum" with 14 meditations on kitchen rituals, small moments of epiphany that tie his childhood oatmeal to his adult polenta or celebrate the genius of the Ziploc bag. Cooks who live in an unchanging climate seem to have a penchant for dividing their cookbooks into seasonal chapters and Tanis is no exception. The (artichoke) heart of this work consists of 20 full menus, five for each season. Spring offerings include Vietnamese vegetable summer rolls, and "The Flavor of Smoke," featuring tea-smoked chicken salad. Summer belongs to herbs with choices like flat-roasted chicken with rosemary, and rice salad with sweet herbs. With the fall comes flatbread, a focaccia served alongside stuffed raviolone. And winter brings fragrant lamb with prunes and almonds. Tanis rounds out the book with four feasts, celebrational meals involving a suckling pig or kid goat stew. When not easing the reader into some potentially complex dishes, Tanis enjoys reliving his culinary European adventures, adding an unfortunate air of pretension to his otherwise sincere labor of love.

The "European anti-novel" in all its unrepentant glory is here in THE COMBINATIONS, following in the tradition of Sterne, Rabelais, Cervantes, Joyce, Perec.Shortlisted for the 2016&nbsp;Not the Booker prize.<br> <br> In 8 octaves, 64 chapters and 888 pages, Louis Armand's THE COMBINATIONS is an unprecedented "work of attempted fiction" that combines the beauty &amp; intellectual exertion that is chess with the panorama of futility &amp; chaos that is Prague (a.k.a. "Golem City"), across the 20th-century and before/after. Golem City, the ship of fools boarded by the famed D's (e.g. John) and K's (e.g. Edward) of the 16th/17th centuries (who attempted and failed to turn lead into gold), and the infamous H's (e.g. Adolf, e.g. Reinhard) of the 20th (who attempted and succeeded in turning flesh into soap). Armand's prose weaves together the City's thousand-and- one fascinating tales with a deeply personal account of one lost soul set adrift amid the early-90s' awakening from the nightmare that was the previous half-century of communist Mitteleuropa. THE COMBINATIONS is a text whose 1) erudition dazzles, 2) structure humbles, 3) monotony never bores, 4) humour disarms, 5) relentlessness overwhelms, 6) storytelling captivates, 7) poignancy remains poignant, and 8) style simply never exhausts itself. Your move, Reader.</p><p>Louis Armand is a writer and visual artist who has lived in Prague since 1994. He has worked as an editor and publisher, and as a subtitles technician at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, and is an editor of <em>VLAK</em> magazine. He is the author of eight novels, including <em>Breakfast at Midnight</em> in 2012, "a perfect modern noir, presenting Kafka's Prague as a bleak, monochrome singularity of darkness, despair and edgy, dry existentialist hardboil" (Richard Marshall, <em>3:AM</em>), CAIRO (Equus Press, 2014; short listed for the <em>Guardian</em>'s Not-the-Booker Prize), and THE COMBINATIONS (Equus Press, 2016). Described as "Robert Pinget does Canetti (in drag in Yugoslavia)," Armand's third novel <em>Clair Obscur</em> was published by Equus in 2011. His previous novel, <em>Menudo</em> (Antigen), was hailed as "unrelenting, a flying wedge, an encyclopaedia of the wasteland, an uzi assault pumping desolation lead... inspiring!" (Thor Garcia, author of <em>The News Clown</em>)."Armand has written an important and corrosive novel, which is a commitment to creativity in the face of absurdity, a politics of avant garde literary concentration and experience that knows, as Camus had it, that:&nbsp;'The innocent is the person who explains nothing.'" (Richard Marshall,&nbsp;<i>3AM magazine</i>)<br>"When an ambitious novelist or playwright decides to compose a modern realistic work--i.e. one imitating das Chaos der Zeit, as H�lderlin called the confusion of&nbsp;his own time, having no idea of what things were to become within a couple more centuries, that is, now, before our eyes--, the dusty so-called classical units become unexpectedly useful again. They provide a center to the chaos. Joyce's&nbsp;<i>Ulysses&nbsp;</i>happens all in Dublin, in a single day. Beckett's plays are models that even Boileau would have approved of. Now Louis Armand, the Australian writer who has lived in Prague for over twenty years at last count, has produced a major modern epic "novel," having Prague instead of Dublin for locale. At about 900 pages, it is a good deal longer than Joyce's&nbsp;<i>Ulysses</i>: if you enjoy the latter, you will find&nbsp;T<i>he Combinations</i>&nbsp;to be almost 200 pages more fun and you will not want to miss it." (Ricardo Nirenberg,&nbsp;<i>Offcourse</i>)<br>"[A]n astonishing creation, a literary journey that I am glad to have experienced [...] It demands time, so much time, and attention." (Jackie Law,&nbsp;<i>Neverimitate</i>)<br>"Louis Armand's&nbsp;<i>The Combinations&nbsp;</i>is a 'great novel' -- long and complex. It exemplifies remarkably the possibilities of the genre and contradicts the contemporary obsession with its decline and commodification.&nbsp;<i>The Combinations</i>&nbsp;unites several narrations, many gnomic and proverbial expressions, various literary frames and historical data/backgrounds. &nbsp;Humor, puns and highlighted commonplaces -- however slightly altered by Armand's '�criture': 'A man's only the sum of his whatsits, after all' -- make the reader able to preserve their own identity and point of view. Comments and pauses are allowed, as shown by the 'Intermission' section. That applies to future amateurs and defines the novel's play upon continuity and discontinuity. In its construction,&nbsp;<i>The Combinations&nbsp;</i>compares with David Mitchell's novels; by its balance between 'totalisation' and 'detotalisation' with Michel Butor's&nbsp;<i>Degr�s</i>. Louis Armand's questioning humor, use of commonplaces, and rewriting of many typological stories recall the reflexive attitude of Robert Coover.&nbsp;The cover of&nbsp;The Combinations&nbsp;should not be ignored either, in that its collage offers a precise introduction to the novel.&nbsp;The Combinations&nbsp;should actually be viewed as starting with its front cover and ending with its back cover. That just confirms the questioning power of the novel, since the cover does not show any text, except for the author's name and the novel's title in quite small print." &nbsp;(Jean Bessi�re, Sorbonne Nouvelle, Paris-III)</p><h2>The Woman&#39;s Bible: A Classic Feminist Perspective</h2><p><p>The publication of <i>The Woman's Bible</i> in 1895 and 1898 represented the last crusade of pioneer feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton to strike at the roots of the ideology behind her gender's subordinate role in society. In the tradition of radical individualism that guided her philosophy, Stanton's attack on religious orthodoxy is more a forceful political treatise than a scholarly work.<br>This clarion call to action, assembled by Stanton and a committee of prominent feminists, consists of a book-by-book examination of the Bible, placing events in their historical context, interpreting passages as both allegory and fact, and comparing them with the myths of other cultures. Over a century later, it endures as an extraordinary document because of the questions it addresses, the topics it covers, and the still-resonant sincerity of its righteous indignation.<br>Readers with an interest in theology, women's studies, or American history will find this milestone of religious and feminist literature an ever-relevant source of information and inspiration.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The US Antifascism Reader</h2><p><b>How anti-fascism is as American as apple pie</b><br><br>Since the birth of fascism in the 1920s, well before the global renaissance of &#x201c;white nationalism,&#x201d; the United States has been home to its own distinct fascist movements, some of which decisively influenced the course of US history. Yet long before &#x201c;antifa&#x201d; became a household word in the United States, they were met, time and again, by an equally deep antifascist current. Many on the left are unaware that the United States has a rich antifascist tradition, because it has rarely been discussed as such, nor has it been accessible in one place. This reader reconstructs the history of US antifascism into the twenty-first century, showing how generations of writers, organizers, and fighters spoke to each other over time. <br><br>Spanning the 1930s to the present, this chronologically-arranged, primary source reader is made up of antifascist writings by Americans and by exiles in the US, some instantly recognizable, others long-forgotten. It also includes a sampling of influential writings from the US fascist, white nationalist, and proto-fascist traditions. Its contents, mostly written by people embedded in antifascist movements, include a number of pieces produced abroad that deeply influenced the US left. The collection thus places US antifascism in a global context.</p><p><b>Bill V. Mullen</b> is Professor of American Studies at Purdue University.

Out of breath, she hadn&#x2019;t stopped to wash the dirt from under her nails. She hovered over the stove, waiting for the teakettle to whistle as she eyed the wound on her finger, still raw. She&#x2019;d clumsily cut it on the edge of the garden shears, and it throbbed beneath the bloodstained bandage. She&#x2019;d tend to it later. Now she needed to come to her senses.</p><p>She poured water in the little white ceramic pot with the hairline crack along the edge and waited for the tea leaves to steep. <i>Could it be?</i> She&#x2019;d seen a bloom, as clear as day. White with pink tips. The Middlebury Pink, she was certain of it. Her husband, rest his soul, had tended to the camellia for twenty years&#x2014;sang to it in the spring, even covered its dark emerald leaves with a quilt when the frost came. Special, he&#x2019;d called it. The woman hadn&#x2019;t understood all the fuss over a scrawny tree, especially when the fields needed plowing and there were potatoes to be harvested.</p><p>If he could only see it now. In bloom. <i>What if someone from the village finds it?</i> No, she couldn&#x2019;t let that happen. It was her responsibility to make sure of that.</p><p>Years ago, her husband spent sixpence on the tree, which was then just a sprout peeking out of a ceramic pot. The traveling salesman told him it had been propagated from a shoot at the base of the Middlebury Pink, the most beautiful camellia in all of England, and perhaps even the world. The only known cultivar, which produced the largest, most stunning blooms&#x2014;white with pink tips&#x2014; presided over the Queen&#x2019;s rose garden inside the gates of the palace. Of course, the woman hadn&#x2019;t believed the tale, not then, and she had scolded her husband for his foolishness in spending such a high price on what might be a weed, but in her heart, she did love to see him happy. And when he looked at the tree, he was happy. &#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s better than squandering money on drink,&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;Besides, if it blooms, maybe we can sell the buds at the market.&#x201d;</p><p>But the tree didn&#x2019;t bloom. Not the first year or the second, or the third or fourth. And by the tenth year, the old woman had given up hope entirely. She grew bitter when her husband whispered to the tree in the mornings. He said he had read about the technique in a garden manual, but when she found him spritzing the tree with a mixture of water and her best vegetable soap, she didn&#x2019;t care that he said it would ward off pests; her patience had worn thin. Sometimes she wished for a bolt of lightning to strike the tree, split it in two, so her husband could stop fawning over it the way he did. She thought, more than once, about taking an ax to its slim trunk and letting the blade slice through the green wood. It would feel good to take out her anger on the tree. But she refrained. And after the man died, the tree remained in the garden. Years passed, and the grass grew high around its trunk. The ivy wrapped its tendrils around the branches. The old woman paid no attention to the camellia until that morning, when a fleck of pink caught her eye. The single saucer-size blossom was more magnificent than she could ever have imagined. More beautiful than any rose she&#x2019;d ever seen, it swayed in the morning breeze with such an air of royalty, the old woman had felt the urge to curtsey in its presence.</p><p>She took another sip of tea. The timing was uncanny. Just days ago, a royal decree had been issued notifying the kingdom that a rare camellia in the Queen&#x2019;s garden had been decimated in a windstorm. Greatly saddened, the Queen had learned that a former palace gardener had propagated a seedling from the tree and sold it to a farmer in the countryside. She had ordered her footmen to search the country for her beloved tree&#x2019;s descendant and to arrest the person who had harbored it all those years.</p><p>The woman stared ahead. She turned to the window when she heard horses&#x2019; hooves in the distance. Moments later, a knock sounded at the door, sending ripples through her tea. She smoothed the wisps of gray hair that had fallen loose from her bun, took a deep breath, and opened the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Good day,&#x201d; said a smartly dressed man. His tone was polite but urgent. &#x201c;Upon orders from Her Majesty, we are searching the country for a certain valuable variety of camellia.&#x201d; The woman eyed the man&#x2019;s clothing&#x2014;plain, common. He was an impostor; even she could tell. Her husband had warned her of the lot&#x2014;flower thieves. Of course, it all fit. If they could get to the camellia before the Queen&#x2019;s footmen, they could command a fortune for it. The man held a page in his hand, rolled up into a tight scroll. Unfurling it with great care, he pointed to the blossom painted on the page, white with pink tips.</p><p>The woman&#x2019;s heart beat so loudly, she could hear nothing else.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know of its whereabouts?&#x201d; the man asked. Without waiting for her reply, he turned to search the garden for himself.</p><p>The man walked along the garden path, past the rows of vegetables and herbs, trampling the carrot greens that had just pushed through the recently thawed soil. He stood looking ahead where the tulips had reared their heads through the black earth. He knelt down to pluck a bud, still green and immature, examining it carefully. &#x201c;If you see the tree,&#x201d; he said, twirling the tulip in his hand, before tossing it behind him, &#x201c;send word to me in town. The name&#x2019;s Harrington.&#x201d;</p><p>The old woman nodded compliantly. The man gestured toward the north. Just over the hill was Livingston Manor. The lady of the house had been kind to them, offering to let them stay in the old cottage by the carriage house so long as they tended the kitchen garden. &#x201c;Better not mention my visit to anyone at the manor,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; the woman said hastily. She stood still, watching as he returned to his horse. When she could no longer hear the <i>click-clack</i> on the road, she followed the garden path past the pear tree near the fence until she came to the camellia bearing its one, glorious bloom.</p><p>No, she thought to herself, touching the delicate blossom. The Queen could search every garden in the land, and the flower thieves could examine every petal, but she would make sure they never found this one.</p><br><br><p><b>Chapter 1 </b></p><p><i>Addison </i></p><p><i>New York City June 1, 2000 </i></p><p>The phone rang from the kitchen, insistent, taunting.

Two.</p><p>The hair on my arms stood on end. What if it was <i>him</i>? He had started calling two weeks ago, and every time the phone rang, I felt the familiar terror. <i>Calm. Deep breath</i>. Maybe it was one of my clients. That horrible Mrs. Atwell, the one who&#x2019;d made me redo her rose garden three times. Or the IRS. Let it be the IRS. Anyone would be more welcome than the person I feared waited on the other end of the line.</p><p>If I turned off the machine, he&#x2019;d call again. Like a shark sensing blood in the water, he&#x2019;d keep circling until he got what he wanted.</p><p>I had to answer it. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I said airily into the receiver.</p><p>Rex looked up, smiled at me, then returned to his notebook.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello again, Addison.&#x201d; His voice made me shiver. I couldn&#x2019;t see him, of course, but I knew his face&#x2014;the patchy stubble that grew around his chin, that amused look in his eyes. &#x201c;You know, I don&#x2019;t care for your new name. <i>Amanda</i> suited you much better.&#x201d;</p><p>I remained silent, quickly opening the French doors and stepping outside onto the patio that overlooked a tiny patch of garden&#x2014; rare for the city, but all ours. A bird chirped happily from the little camellia tree Rex and I had planted last year on our first wedding anniversary. I hated that he was trespassing on my private sanctuary.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;I told you to stop calling me.&#x201d; I looked up at the apartment building behind our townhouse, wondering if he could see me from one of the windows above.</p><p>&#x201c;Amanda, Amanda,&#x201d; he said, amused.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop calling me that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I forgot,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all fancy now. I read about your wedding in the paper.&#x201d; He clicked his tongue scoldingly. &#x201c;Quite the fairy-tale ending for a girl who&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I said. I couldn&#x2019;t bear the sound of his voice, the way it made me think of the past. &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you leave me alone?&#x201d; I begged.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean, you don&#x2019;t <i>miss</i> me? Think of all the good times we had together. You remember the way we used to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; I said, cringing.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I see how it is,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All stuck-up now that you married the <i>King of England</i>. You think you&#x2019;re really something. Well, let me ask you this: Does your husband know <i>who you really are</i>? Does he know what you&#x2019;ve <i>done</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>I felt sick, woozy. &#x201c;Please, please leave me alone,&#x201d; I pleaded, feeling my throat tightening as I swallowed.</p><p>He laughed to himself. &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No. You see, I spent ten years of my life in prison. That&#x2019;s a long time to think about things. And I thought a lot about you, Amanda. Almost every day.&#x201d;</p><p>I shuddered. With him behind bars, I&#x2019;d felt a false sense of security. His incarceration, for two felony counts of money laundering and a lesser charge of statutory rape, had felt like a thick, warm blanket wrapped around me. And now that he was out, the blanket had been ripped off. I felt exposed, frightened.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the thing, baby,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting on a very valuable piece of information. I mean, you can&#x2019;t blame me for wanting the same cushy life you have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to hang up now,&#x201d; I said, my finger hovering over the End Call button.</p><p>&#x201c;This can all end well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You know what I want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I already told you I don&#x2019;t have that kind of money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You may not,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but your husband&#x2019;s family does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t bring them into this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;then I have no other choice.&#x201d; I heard the chime of an ice cream truck on the other end of the line. I remembered chasing after those trucks as a little girl, wide-eyed, hopeful. I don&#x2019;t know why; I never had a dollar for an ice cream sandwich, and yet they lured me still.</p><p>I pulled the phone from my ear and listened as the same notes sounded, a block away, perhaps. The melody struck terror in me. The truck was close. Too close.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; I asked, suddenly panicked.</p><p>&#x201c;Why? You want to see me?&#x201d; he said, amused. I could picture the menacing grin on his face.</p><p>My chin quivered. &#x201c;Please, leave me alone,&#x201d; I pleaded. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you just leave me alone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It could have been so easy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve tried my patience. If I don&#x2019;t have the money by the end of the week, I&#x2019;ll have no other choice but to tell your husband everything. And when I say &#x2018;everything,&#x2019; I mean <i>everything</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;Please!&#x201d;</p><p>I walked around the building and peered beyond the fence at the side yard. The ice cream truck motored past, slowly. Children cheered and squealed as the melodic chimes poured through the loudspeaker, and yet, with each note, I became increasingly paralyzed with terror. &#x201c;You have five days, Amanda,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And, by the way, you look stunning in that dress. Blue&#x2019;s your color.&#x201d;</p><p>The line went dead, and I looked down at my blue linen dress, before turning to the street. The walnut tree in the distance. An old Honda with tinted windows and a rusty hood parked nearby. A bus stop that cast jagged shadows on the sidewalk.</p><p>I ran back to the house and closed the French doors, locking them behind me. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to England,&#x201d; I said to Rex, breathless.</p><p>He pushed his dark-rimmed glasses higher on the bridge of his nose. &#x201c;really?&#x201d; He looked confused. &#x201c;I thought you didn&#x2019;t want to make the trip. Why the change of heart?&#x201d;</p><p>My in-laws had recently purchased a historic manor in the English countryside, and they&#x2019;d invited Rex and me to stay there for the summer while they continued their travels throughout Asia, where Rex&#x2019;s father, James, was working. Rex, whose novel-in-progress was set in a manor in the English countryside, thought it would be perfect for research. And we both shared a love of old homes. From what his mother, Lydia, had said on the phone, the estate brimmed with history.</p><p>But the timing was off. My landscape design business had enjoyed a surge of activity, and I was juggling four new clients, including a massive garden installation on a rooftop in Manhattan. It was a terrible time to leave. And yet now I had no choice. Sean didn&#x2019;t know about the manor. He wouldn&#x2019;t find me there. The trip would give me time to think.</p><p>My eyes darted around the living room nervously. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t. . . . I mean, I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I sighed, collecting myself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just been thinking it over, and, well, maybe we do need a getaway. Our anniversary is coming up.&#x201d; I sat down on the couch beside him, twirling a lock of his shiny dark hair between my fingers. &#x201c;I could explore the gardens, maybe even learn a thing or two; you know everyone&#x2019;s crazy about English gardens here.&#x201d; I was talking fast, the way I do when I&#x2019;m worried. Rex could tell, I know, because he squeezed my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re nervous about the airplane, aren&#x2019;t you, honey?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>True, I did have a bit of airplane fright, and my doctor had prescribed Xanax for such moments. But, no, Rex didn&#x2019;t know the real reason for my anxiety, and I could never let him find out.</p><p>There was a time when I believed I&#x2019;d tell him the truth about me. But the longer I waited, the more it seemed impossible to open my mouth and utter the painful words. So I didn&#x2019;t. Instead, I hid behind my carefully crafted story. A girl from a wealthy family in New Hampshire whose parents had died in a car accident years ago. The money that had all been lost in a fraudulent investment scheme. Rex had believed it all, believed in <i>me</i>. He didn&#x2019;t wonder why I didn&#x2019;t get Christmas cards or birthday calls. He didn&#x2019;t ask if I wanted to visit my childhood home. He admired my strength, he said, that I could live in the present and not mourn the past. <i>If only you knew</i>.</p><p>I tucked my hand in his. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And you said that the house would be the perfect place to really dig into your research&#x2014;let&#x2019;s do it, Rex. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, touching my cheek lightly. &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;d love to make the trip, but only if you&#x2019;re certain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I said, shifting my gaze to the window and eyeing the rusty car parked on the street. I stood up and pulled the drapes closed. &#x201c;The sun&#x2019;s so bright today.&#x201d; I continued, reaching for my phone, &#x201c;I bet I can call the travel agency and get tickets for tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;really?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That quick?&#x201d;</p><p>I forced a smile. &#x201c;Why not? We might as well make the most of the summer.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The &#34;Trapdoor&#34; Springfield: From the Little Bighorn to San Juan Hill (Weapon)</h2><p><p>Intended to replace the proliferation of different small arms fielded by US forces during the American Civil War, the &#x201c;Trapdoor Springfield&#x201d; was designed in 1865&#x2013;66 by Erskine S. Allin. Using metallic cartridges, it could be loaded in a single action, increasing the number of shots per minute as much as fivefold. The new weapon quickly proved its worth in two separate incidents in August 1867: small groups of US soldiers and civilians armed with the trapdoor repulsed numerically superior Native American contingents. A simple and cost-effective weapon, it was used, along with its variants in every US conflict in the three decades after the Civil War, especially on the American frontier.</p><p>Drawing upon first-hand accounts from US soldiers, their Native American opponents, and users such as buffalo hunters, this is the story of the &#x201c;Trapdoor Springfield,&#x201d; one of the defining weapons of the Indian Wars.</p></p><p><p><b>John P.

This third book in the Roman Mysteries series continues the first-century B.C.E. adventures of teen sleuth Flavia and her sidekicks. This title begins in a refugee camp in the aftermath of Vesuvius' eruption. While assisting the camps' doctors, Flavia and her friends discover that many children have disappeared in the chaos. Suspecting a kidnapping plot, the friends investigate, and their inquiries lead them to the opulent villa of a wealthy, charming nobleman. Is he behind the kidnappings? The friends discover the answer in a series of terrifying near-death adventures. As in the series' previous titles, Lawrence combines vivid period details and graceful imagery with a thrilling pace and some gory action scenes, always portraying Flavia and her friends as well-drawn young people whose playfulness, jealousies, outrage, and courage will resonate with contemporary readers. Additional themes of slavery and class issues add depth to the plot, while a glossary defines the many Roman terms used throughout. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But one afternoon things went wildly awry when he chased a thief&#x2014;a woman using stolen checks&#x2014;into the parking lot. She jumped into her car, and her accomplice gunned the accelerator, slamming the car into Michell and sending him to the hospital with a broken kneecap, a badly torn shoulder, and two herniated disks. Michell was so devoted to Wal-Mart that he somehow returned to work the next day, but a few weeks later he told his boss that he needed surgery on his knee. He was fired soon afterward, apparently as part of a strategy to dismiss workers whose injuries run up Wal-Mart&#x2019;s workers&#x2019; comp bills.�Immediately after serving in the army, Dawn Eubanks took a seven-dollar-an-hour job at a call center in Florida. Some days she was told to clock in just two or three hours, and some days she was not allowed to clock in during her whole eight-hour shift. The call center&#x2019;s managers warned the workers that if they went home, even though they weren&#x2019;t allowed to clock in, they would be viewed as having quit.�Twenty-eight-year-old John Arnold works in the same Caterpillar factory in Illinois as his father, but under the plant&#x2019;s two-tier contract, the maximum he can ever earn is $14.90 an hour, far less than the $25 earned by his father. Caterpillar, long a symbol of America&#x2019;s industrial might, insists that it needs a lower wage tier to remain competitive. &#x201c;A few people I work with are living at home with their parents,&#x201d; Arnold said. &#x201c;Some are even on food stamps.&#x201d;�At a Koch Foods poultry plant in Tennessee, the managers were so intent on keeping the line running all out that Antonia Lopez Paz and the other workers who carved off chicken tenders were ordered not to go to the bathroom except during their lunch and coffee breaks.

She felt great loyalty to the Seattle-area company because its executives had repeatedly promised, &#x201c;As long as we&#x2019;re in business, you have a job.&#x201d; But one Friday morning the company suddenly fired Bronstein and seventeen other quality assurance engineers. The engineers were told that if they wanted to receive severance pay, they had to agree to spend the next month training the workers from India who would be replacing them.One of the least examined but most important trends taking place in the United States today is the broad decline in the status and treatment of American workers&#x2014;white-collar and blue-collar workers, middle-class and low-end workers&#x2014;that began nearly three decades ago, gradually gathered momentum, and hit with full force soon after the turn of this century. A profound shift has left a broad swath of the American workforce on a lower plane than in decades past, with health coverage, pension benefits, job security, workloads, stress levels, and often wages growing worse for millions of workers.That the American worker faces this squeeze in the early years of this century is particularly troubling because the squeeze has occurred while the economy, corporate profits, and worker productivity have all been growing robustly. In recent years, a disconcerting disconnect has emerged, with corporate profits soaring while workers&#x2019; wages stagnated.The statistical evidence for this squeeze is as compelling as it is disturbing. In 2005, median income for nonelderly households failed to increase for the sixth year in a row, after factoring in inflation. That is unprecedented in a time of economic growth. In 2006, median income for those households did finally rise, but it still remained lower&#x2014;$2,375 lower&#x2014;than seven years earlier. That, too, is unprecedented. Even though corporate profits have doubled since recession gave way to economic expansion in November 2001, and even though employee productivity has risen more than 15 percent since then, the average wage for the typical American worker has inched up just 1 percent (after inflation). With the subprime mortgage crisis threatening to pull the economy into recession, some economists say this may be the first time in American history that the typical working household goes through an economic expansion without any increase in income whatsoever.This, unfortunately, is the continuation of a long-term squeeze. Since 1979, hourly earnings for 80 percent of American workers (those in private-sector, nonsupervisory jobs) have risen by just 1 percent, after inflation. The average was was $17.71 at the end of 2007. For male workers, the average hourly wage actually slid by 5 percent since 1979. Worker productivity, meanwhile, climbed 60 percent. If wages had kept pace with productivity, the average full-time worker would be earning $58,000 a year; $36,000 was the average in 2007. The nation&#x2019;s economic pie is growing, but corporations by and large have not given their workers a bigger piece.The squeeze on the American worker has meant more poverty, more income inequality, more family tensions, more hours at work, more time away from the kids, more families without health insurance, more retirees with inadequate pensions, and more demands on government and taxpayers to provide housing assistance and health coverage. Twenty percent of families with children under six live below the poverty line, and 22 million full-time workers do not have health insurance. Largely as a result of the squeeze, the number of housing foreclosures and personal bankruptcies more than tripled in the quarter century after 1979. Economic studies show that income inequality in the United States is so great that it more closely resembles the inequality of a third world country than that of an advanced industrial nation.Many families are enjoying higher incomes, enabling them to buy a plasma-screen TV or take a vacation in Orlando, but this is frequently because fathers have taken on second jobs or more overtime hours or because mothers, even with toddlers, have opted for full-time paid employment. Millions of households have not slipped further behind only because Americans are working far harder than before. A husband and wife in the average middle-class household are, taken together, working 540 hours or three months more per year than such couples would have a quarter century ago, largely because married women are working considerably longer hours than before.Viewed another way, the American worker&#x2019;s financial squeeze has translated into a time squeeze. In a survey by the Families and Work Institute, two-thirds of employed parents responded that they didn&#x2019;t have enough time with their kids, and just under two-thirds said they didn&#x2019;t have enough time with their spouses. The typical American worker toils 1,804 hours a year, 135 hours more per year than the typical British worker, 240 hours more than the average French worker, and 370 hours (or nine full-time weeks) more than the average German worker. No one in the world&#x2019;s advanced economies works more. Aggravating the time squeeze is a phenomenon known as job creep in which our jobs have spilled increasingly into our leisure time. Americans are finishing work memos on their home computers at eleven p.m., they are reading office e-mails on Saturdays and Sundays, and they are using their cell phones and BlackBerries to answer their bosses&#x2019; queries while on vacation. The Conference Board, the business research group, found that Americans are less satisfied with their jobs&#x2014;just 47 percent are satisfied&#x2014;than at any time since it started tracking the numbers two decades ago. &#x201c;The breadth of dissatisfaction is unsettling,&#x201d; the Conference Board wrote, its director of research adding, &#x201c;The demands in the workplace have increased tremendously.&#x201d;Americans are going deeper into debt than ever before. Millions of households have supersized their credit card balances, and many have taken cash out of their homes by obtaining second mortgages, arguably unhealthy ways to try to maintain a comfortable lifestyle on a less-than-comfortable income. In 2005, for the first time since the Great Depression, the nation&#x2019;s personal savings rate sank below zero, meaning that Americans were actually spending more than they were earning. As a result, among the bottom two-fifths of households, nearly one in four spends at least 40 percent of its monthly income paying down its debts. And foreclosure filings, spurred by the subprime mortgage crisis, were expected to soar to as many as two million in 2007. Two million foreclosures would represent one in sixty-two households.Even as wages stagnated in recent years, many government officials triumphantly boasted that consumer spending had continued to rise. But this increase was largely due to soaring incomes at the top. From 1979 to 2005, after-tax income inched up just 6 percent for the bottom fifth of American households after accounting for inflation, while it rose 21 percent for the middle fifth. For the top fifth, income jumped 80 percent and for the top 1 percent it more than tripled, soaring by 228 percent. A 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that the top 1 percent of households had pre-tax income in 2005 that was more than two-fifths larger than that of the bottom 40 percent. (After taxes, the top 1 percent&#x2019;s income in 2005 was still nearly 10 percent more than the bottom 40 percent&#x2019;s.) As Paul Krugman wrote, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a great economy if you&#x2019;re a high-level corporate executive or someone who owns a lot of stock. For most other Americans, economic growth is a spectator sport.&#x201d;The nation appears to be on the threshold of recession, and as a result, America's workers are likely to be squeezed not just by stagnant wages but also by rising unemployment. One of the most worrisome--and puzzling--aspects of the economic expansion that began in November 2001 is that wages have remained stubbornly flat, after factoring in inflation, even though the jobless rate has been low by historical standards. That wages have gone nowhere in a tight labor market underlines the American worker's declining ability to command higher wages, and now with unemployment increasing, workers' leverage to push for higher wages is bound to grow even weaker. The squeeze is of course worst for those on the lowest rungs, including millions of workers who are part of our everyday lives: fast food workers, cashiers, child care workers, hotel maids, and nurse's aides. Nearly 33 million workers--almost one-fourth of the American workforce--earn less than ten dollars an hour, meaning their wages come to less than the poverty line for a family of four ($20,614 in 2006). Despite strong economic growth, the number of Americans living in poverty jumped by 15 percent from 2000 to 2006--an increase of 5.4 million to 36.5 million.For millions of low-income workers, the promise of America has been broken: the promise that if you work hard, you will be rewarded with a decent living, the promise that if you do an honest day's work, you will earn enough to feed, clothe, and shelter your family.Not only do workers on the bottom rungs lack money, but they often lack basic benefits. Three out of four low-wage workers in the private sector do not have employer-provided health insurance, while eight out of nine do not participate in a pension plan. Three-fourths of low-wage workers do not receive paid sick days, so if they need to miss two days "work because they are sick or their child is sick, they receive no pay for those days and often risk getting fired.A study sponsored by the Ford, Rockefeller, and Annie E. Casey foundations,"Working Hard, Falling Short," concluded "More than one out of four American working families now earn wages so low"--defined as income of less than twice the poverty line for a family of four ($41,200 in 2006)--"that they have difficulty surviving financially." The study continued, "While our economy relies on the service jobs these low-paid workers fill . . . our society has not taken adequate steps to ensure that these workers can make ends meet and build a future for their families, no matter how determined they are to be self-sufficient." In her book <i>Nickel and Dimed, </i>Barbara Ehrenreich described these workers as "the major philanthropists of our society." Ehrenreich wrote, "They neglect their own children so the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect." Across America more than 50 million people live in near poor households, those with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 a year. Katherine Newman, a Princeton sociologist, has described this large but often overlooked group as "the missing class." The mass of workers who are barely getting by is likely to grow only larger, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that low-wage jobs will account for six of the top ten categories in overall job growth between now and 2014: janitors, nursing home aides, waiters, home-health aides, retail sales workers including cashiers, and food-prep and fast food workers.America's ailing health care system is a big part of the worsening squeeze. From 2000 to 2006, the number of Americans without health insuranceclimbed by 8.6 million, to 47 million. One study found that more than two-fifths of moderate-income, working-age Americans went without health insurance for at least part of 2005. Not only that, for employees who want coverage, companies are requiring them to pay more for it, and as a result, the cost of family coverage has soared 83 percent in just six years. As health costs consume more and more of the nation's economic output--they account for 16 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP, up from 5 percent in 1960--that necessarily leaves less money for wage increases. Pensions, the other pillar of employee benefits, are under assault as never before. In May 2005, a bankruptcy judge allowed United Airlines to default on its pension plans and dump them on the federal agency that protects retirement benefits. Because that agency guarantees pensions only up to a certain amount, many United pilots will receive only half what they expected when they retire. United's move was the biggest pension default in American history, releasing it from paying $3.2 billion in obligations over the following five years. One of United's lawyers predicted that more and more companies would use this "strategic tool" to increase their competitiveness. Since then, US Airways and Delta have followed suit. When Delphi, the auto parts giant, filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, its chief executive, Robert S. Miller, threatened to slash the company's pensions unless the workers agreed to massive wage concessions.As part of this assault on pensions, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Verizon, Sears, Motorola, and many other companies have embraced a riskier, far less generous type of retirement plan, 401(k)s, while turning away from the traditional plans that promised workers a specific monthly benefit for life after they retired. When Hewlett-Packard took that step, a company spokesman said, "Pension plans are kind of a thing of the past."With pensions growing ever scarcer, more and more workers are convinced...</p><h2>Autobiography (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p><p>Steven Patrick Morrissey was born in Manchester on May 22nd 1959.

What is so refreshing about Morrissey's <i>Autobiography</i> is its very messiness, its deliriously florid, overblown prose style, its unwillingness to kowtow to a culture of literary formula and commercial pigeon-holing ... <i>Autobiography</i> is a true baggy monster, a book in which a distinctive prose style is allowed to develop ...

For centuries, Christians have seen him as a deity who shows favor to some and dispenses punishment to others according to right belief and correct behavior. But this transactional approach to a God &#x201c;up there&#x201d;&#x2014;famously depicted by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel&#x2014;no longer works, if it ever did, leaving an increasing number of Christians upset, disappointed, and heading for the exits. <br><br> In this groundbreaking, inspiring book, Robin R. Meyers, the senior minister of Oklahoma City&#x2019;s Mayflower Congregational United Church of Christ, shows how readers can move from a theology of obedience to one of consequence. He argues that we need to stop seeing our actions as a means for pleasing a distant God and rediscover how God has empowered us to care for ourselves and the world. Drawing on stories from his decades of active ministry, Meyers captures how the struggles of ordinary people hint at how we can approach faith as a radical act of trust in a God who is all around us, even in our doubts and the moments of life we fear the most.</p><p><b>Robin Meyers </b>is a Christian minister, peace activist, philosophy professor, and writer on progressive Christianity and Western society.

He never lets us &#x2018;fly off the page&#x2019; into some abstract, unwieldy realm but rather calls us to existential trust, where the sacred and profane meet.

This untold story of aviation history also has a major bearing on the development of civil aviation. The book, and its companion volume, <i>American Secret Projects 2</i>, covers airlifter designs from WWII to the start of the 1960s, and has been made possible by the authors being given unprecedented access to major aerospace company archives, uncovering scores of design proposals which have never previously been revealed. As well as describing how airlifters were progressively developed to meet evermore demanding military transport requirements, the book looks at their other roles, from nuclear test-beds to Space Shuttle carriers.

Savushun (pronounced &#34;sa-voo-shoon&#34;) is a folk tradition, surviving in Southern Iran from an undateable pre-islamic past, that conjures hope in spite of everything. The novel chronicles the life of a Persian family during the World War II Allied occupation of Iran. It is set in Shiraz, a town which evokes images of Persepolis and pre-islamic monuments, the great Persian poets, the shrines, sufis and nomadic tribes all within a historical web of the interests, privilege and influence of foreign powers, corruption, incompetence and arrogance of persons in authority. The story is seen through the eyes of Zari, a young wife, and mother, who copes with her idealistic husband while struggling with her desire for traditional family life and her need for an individual identity. simin daneshvar lives and continues to write in Iran.</p><p>Among contemporary writers of Iran, the majority of whom are men, one woman stands out: Simin Daneshvar.

Sionil Jose begins his five-novel Rosales Saga, which the poet and critic Ricaredo Demetillo called "the first great Filipino novels written in English." Set in the 1880s, <b>Dusk</b> records the exile of a tenant family from its village and the new life it attempts to make in the small town of Rosales. Here commences the epic tale of a family unwillingly thrown into the turmoil of history. But this is more than a historical novel; it is also the eternal story of man's tortured search for true faith and the larger meaning of existence. Jose has achieved a fiction of extraordinary scope and passion, a book as meaningful to Philippine literature as <b>One Hundred Years of Solitude</b> is to Latin American literature.<br>"The foremost Filipino novelist in English, his novels deserve a much wider readership than the Philippines can offer."--Ian Buruma, New York Review of Books<br>"Tolstoy himself, not to mention Italo Svevo, would envy the author of this story."--Chicago Tribune</p><p>The Philippines are an Asian anomaly: a primarily Catholic nation bred on European and American culture, the country has long been subjugated by foreign powers and homegrown dictators alike, leaving the people to quietly endure. But as F. Sionil Jos� proves, they have never been silenced. One of the premier novelists in the Philippines (he won the Magsaysay Award, the Asian equivalent of the Nobel, in 1980), Jos�'s acclaimed Rosales saga chronicles the Filipino struggles and triumphs during the 20th century. <i>Dusk</i>, the fifth book in the saga but the first released in the United States, showcases a writer who deserves a much wider audience. <p> This rich historical novel takes place at the end of the 19th century as the Filipinos, with the aid of the Americans, finally expelled the Spanish after three centuries of often brutal rule. Major themes are on display here--war and peace; rich versus poor; tyranny versus freedom--all passionately presented within the context of one man and his family. After being unjustly dismissed from the seminary by a corrupt priest and then suffering the death of his brother at the hands of Spanish authorities, Istak Samson is forced to flee from increasing oppression and lead his family on a journey for a new home. This harsh quest from the coast to the central plains eventually leads Samson to find love, peace, and relative prosperity, as well as provide a device for Jos� to vividly describe the beauty and complexity of his homeland and to elaborate on the cultural effects of Spanish occupation. The joy Samson finds, like Philippine independence, is short-lived, as the Filipinos soon engage in a bloody conflict with the Americans, who have substituted Spanish imperialism with their own. Unable to reconcile his pacifist nature with his sense of duty to his country, Samson reluctantly joins the rebel forces in their battle to reassert their freedom. After setting the stage for tragedy, Jos� does not follow an easy route to a happy ending but instead builds to a climax that is moving, if not unexpected. In telling his epic tale from the perspective of a common peasant, Jos� lends a powerful voice to a people long trapped in the midst of historical upheaval.</p>With Dusk (originally published in the Philippines as Po-on), F.

But this is more than a historical novel; it is also the eternal story of man&#39;s tortured search for true faith and the larger meaning of existence. Jose carefully begins to paint a portrait of his country, showing the terrible physical and emotional hardships the people endure as the Philippines is transformed by the &#34;liberation&#34; from Spanish rule and by the oppression that continues, even as the Americans take over. Still, far from drawing a picture of hopelessness, Jose&#39; has achieved a fiction of extraordinary scope and passion, a book as meaningful to Philippine literature as One Hundred Years of Solitude is to Latin American literature.</p><h2>Life Before Birth</h2><p><p>Life is special...A book for Christian families and others who teach the dignity of Life Before Birth to this and future generations. </p><p>Dr. Parker and his wife, Mary, explain the Biblical view of life before birth.

Your comments have hit the core of our marital issues; mostly related to our respective sexual identities, desires and the need to communicate, understand and accept each other for our differences. She reads and looks forward to your writings as well. It definitely has made a positive difference at home while we struggle to decide which outcome is best for us and our children."--D.J.L. "For myself and for my husband of 57 years, as well as for my patients, your daily reflections are a splendid reminder of what's important as we go through our busy days.

Jules Boykoff, a former US Olympic team member, takes readers from the event&#x2019;s nineteenth-century origins, through the Games&#x2019; flirtation with Fascism, and into the contemporary era of corporate control. Along the way he recounts vibrant alt-Olympic movements, such as the Workers&#x2019; Games and Women&#x2019;s Games of the 1920s and 1930s as well as athlete-activists and political movements that stood up to challenge the Olympic machine.</p><p><b>Jules Boykoff</b> is the author of <i>Activism and the Olympics</i>, <i>Celebration Capitalism and the Olympic Games</i>, <i>Landscapes of Dissent</i>, and <i>Beyond Bullets: The Suppression of Dissent in the United States</i>, among others.

As Jules Boykoff chronicles in this pathbreaking history, host cities have used the Games to leverage urban renewal, neighborhood demolition, and mass population displacement. The preparations for the Rio Olympics have gone one step further and become a literal urban counterinsurgency, as elite police units occupy and &#x2018;cleanse&#x2019; one favela after another.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Mike Davis, author of <i>Planet of Slums</i><br></b><br> &#x201c;Takes us deep into the heart of the Olympic industry ... <i>Power Games</i> chronicles a wide range of resistance, including indigenous people who have struggled to defend their lands and rights against the Olympic juggernaut, showing us how all of our interests are intertwined.

Beginning with observations on the recent discovery of Roman antiquities in the form of burial urns, Browne&#x2019;s associative mind wanders to elephant graveyards, to pre-Christian cremation ceremonies, and finally to the idea of Christian burial. Browne then explores, with a more melancholic meditation, man&#x2019;s struggles with mortality and the uncertainty of his fate and fame in the living world. This edition includes a magisterial discourse on Sir Thomas Browne taken from the first chapter of W. G. Sebald&#x2019;s <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>.</p><p><p><strong>Sir Thomas Browne</strong> (1605&#x2013;1682) was an English Renaissance author and physician. He wrote extensively about medicine, geography, philosophy, and Christian spirituality.</p><p><strong>W. G. Sebald</strong> was born in Germany in 1944 and died in 2001. He is the author of <em>The Emigrants</em>, <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>, <em>Vertigo</em>, <em>Austerlitz</em>, <em>After Nature</em>, <em>On the Natural History of Destruction</em>, <em>Unrecounted</em> and <em>Campo Santo</em>.</p>In the mid 17th century, some 40 to 50 Roman burial urns were uncovered in the fields of Norfolk, the occasion of which moved Dr. Thomas Browne to reflect on the significance of their contents, as well as on the ultimate insignificance of their discovery. This gorgeous new edition reintroduces Browne's seminal meditation on impermanence. Browne explores the quirk of fate that these seemingly delicate urns of ash and bone remained unharmed, despite the work of the plow and the destruction of most everything above ground. He also considers the response to death of various faiths and traditions, those who do and do not cremate their dead. His quiet language is profound and humble, timeless as well as singularly poignant. Sebald's preface, excerpted from The Rings of Saturn, introduces Browne's life and work as a physician, along with Sebald's own account of his search for Browne's skull, rumored to have been kept in a museum hospital. Additionally, Sebald paints the landscape of Browne's Renaissance contemporaries as they too engaged with the remains of the dead, notably Rembrandt's painting of human dissection. The pairing of these two works accentuates the importance of both. (Sept.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

In a house on the Cape &#x201c;older than the Republic,&#x201d; Robert MacIver, a historian who long ago played rugby for Scotland, creates a list of rules by which to live out his last days. The most important rule, to &#x201c;tell a story to its end,&#x201d; spurs the old Scot on to invent a strange and gripping tale of men in the trenches of the First World War. <br><br>Drawn from a depth of knowledge and imagination, MacIver conjures the implacable, clear-sighted artist Private Callum; the private&#x2019;s nemesis Sergeant Braddis, with his pincerlike nails; Lieutenant Simon Dodds, who takes on Braddis; and Private Charlie Alston, who is ensnared in this story of inhumanity and betrayal but brings it to a close.<br><br>This invented tale of the Great War prompts MacIver&#x2019;s own memories of his role in World War II and of Vietnam, where his son, David served. Both the stories and the memories alike are lit by the vivid presence of Margaret, his wife. As Hearts and Minds director Peter Davis writes, &#x201c;Pouncey has wrought an almost inconceivable amount of beauty from pain, loss, and war, and I think he has been able to do this because every page is imbued with the love story at the heart of his astonishing novel.&#x201d;</p><p>Peter Pouncey was born in Tsingtao, China, of English parents. At the end of World War II, after several dislocations and separations, the family reassembled in England, and Pouncey was educated there in boarding schools and at Oxford. A classicist, former dean of Columbia College, and president emeritus of Amherst College, Peter Pouncey lives in New York City and northern Connecticut with his wife. This is his first novel.CHAPTER 1<br><br>Rules to Stop the Rot<br><br> The house and the old man were well matched, both large framed and failing fast. The house had a better excuse, MacIver thought; he was eighty, but the house was older than the Republic, had been a century old when Thoreau walked the Cape, though he couldn&#x2019;t have seen it tucked away in the nondescript maze of scrub oak. It had been the willful seclusion of the place that had appealed to them when they first saw it&#x2014;that and the equally hidden pool, about two minutes away through their woods, which must have decided the builder to choose the site. The oaks grew more substantial as they approached the pond, but the casual visitor would not have registered their rising height as the ground fell away down to the water. But when the path did its last little jink through the thicket of spare mossy trunks and last year&#x2019;s leaves, you stood on the edge of something suddenly spacious. A stretch of almost two hundred yards of water, more than fifty wide, a glade of water, fringed at both ends by sedge and reeds, shaded along the sides by the larger oaks. Bird-loud by day, redwings and warblers in and out of the reeds and busy water-traffic of ducks, and even, for a few seasons, the stately progressions of a pair of swans; owls with their fluttery hoots at night, and very often at the far end beyond a fallen log, the hunched figure of a black-crowned night heron, the grim presiding judge executing sentence on a surprising number of small fish and frogs.<br><br>Margaret and he had watched the pond over the years at every hour in every season. In summer, it was their swimming pool, where they swam naked at any time of day. Often on hot August nights, they would have a last dip before bed. They would take one towel between them, and no flashlight, because the night sky overhead was bright enough to light their way down the faint, twisting path. MacIver, an energetic but clumsy swimmer, would thrash the water into turbulence out into the deep and then make for shore, and try to use the towel as little as possible, to leave it dry for Margaret. She would go on a while longer, parting the water gently in her rhythmic breast-stroke, the moonlight playing on her wet hair with each forward surge, a sleek and quiet otter. He would lose her in the shadowed background at the far end, and peer with great concentration into the dark, to catch the first ripple of her return. When she finally waded towards the bank where he was standing, he would stay motionless trying to register the first moment when he could see into her silhouette, and detect the dark roundness of her nipples and the triangle of her pubic hair. Then she would let him dry her off, and they would go home to bed.<br><br>In other seasons, dressed for the weather, they would take their station under one of the oaks, his back to the trunk, with Margaret sitting between his legs, and simply let the life of the pool evolve around them. They had seen families of deer come down to drink, they had seen a raccoon balance on a log and try to fish with his paw, and one evening in the last of the light, they had seen a great horned owl sail out from the tree above them and swoop on a small rabbit on the other side of the pond. They had heard the short squeal, and seen the inert furry bundle dangling from the bird&#x2019;s talons as he passed over them on his return. Many foxes, and once he would have sworn a bobcat, though it can&#x2019;t have been, padding along the far bank and back into the trees. You never knew what you would see. MacIver named the pond the Blind Pool, from a favorite boyhood story, though it was called Frog Pond on his geodetic map, and Margaret had called the house Night Heron House in honor of the constant sentinel standing by his fallen branch; she did a fine woodcut of him, too, which still hung inside the front door.<br><br>It was a traditional Cape house, but on a larger scale than was usual, a bold architect&#x2019;s airy enlargement. The front rooms were high ceilinged and framed with more massive beams, and instead of the usual chicken-run stairs inside the front door, there was a handsome Y-shaped staircase down a wide hall, breaking at a little landing halfway up and then splitting to left and right for the upper rooms. A Victorian owner had widened the two front windows and bowed them, letting in more light, and then had built a porch between the two bows, with central steps up to the front door and a simple railing on either side. The house stood by itself in a clearing, which you had to maintain vigilantly: half a summer, and the locust, oak, and birch sprigs would be crowding onto the grass. Original glass in many panes; the shapes of things outside alternately clouded and cleared as your eyes moved across the windows. Original two-foot-wide floorboards and paneling on the walls, flouting an ancient Massachusetts statute reserving such width for the absent king. A cool, self-possessed house of mellow resonance, as if you were living inside a spacious cello. Nothing too decorative.<br><br>They had three and a half decades to set their rhythms, coming and going to their secret fastness, the Night Heron House with its woods and pond. When Margaret fell ill and the doctors said they could do no more for her, they had moved to the Cape, as they had always planned in such a case, &#x201c;year-round&#x201d;; in fact, she had three seasons left, fall to spring, 1986&#x2013;1987. At first the house had seemed to banish sickness. They had moved their bed into the living room, so she would not have to manage the stairs, but in the large, airy space she bustled light-footed as ever; she set up her easel, and started a series of tree-scapes framed by the windows at different times of the day. The trees on the canvas got barer, MacIver noticed, as the season turned, but the paintings got lighter, at first because the angle of focus was raised to allow more cloud and sky, and at the end, in the unfinished ones, because the marks on the prepared white canvas, while precisely made, were fainter, less assertive: the effect left on her only viewer was of being pulled in her art past the blank of whiteness to the vanishing point of thin air.<br><br>As winter approached, they would still visit the pond on good days, though they didn&#x2019;t stay long to absorb its more furtive movement; they would come out at the end of the path and stand a few moments looking, an old couple supporting each other in a lover&#x2019;s stance, heads inclined towards each other, his rangy arm around her frail shoulders, her mittened hand around his waist. Then they would work their way back; she only needed a sighting, it seemed. Things were moving faster for them now, forcing changes they could not plan. In no time the number of hours she could be up each day, the number of feet she could walk, were shortening on them. By the end of February, she was confined to bed, daily falling further away from him deeper into sickness. He was ill himself, he knew, but nothing to this. First weekly, then twice a week, he would make grim sallies to the drugstore for the morphine prescribed from New York, and come back as fast as he dared, fearful of finding another visible weakening. There was no talk of going somewhere else for final care. It would end here, in this room. He would read to her, coax her to eat a little, play Mozart to her, spin new tales she would like about his boyhood on Loch Affric, and games and battles farther afield. When she drowsed, he would stay sitting on in the bentwood rocker through the fading afternoon. She would wake up and read his unguarded face; she could see her fierce old Scot being gentled out of character by his own secret illness, never to be mentioned, and by grief.<br><br>It was all grotesquely new to him; he was not a man who had ever willingly let things be taken out of his hands. Sometimes she would send him on small missions, to shake him out of his spellbound broodings. She would ask him to go down to the pond, &#x201c;and report back on your findings.&#x201d; At first in the winter, he would have to work hard for interesting gleanings to take back to her&#x2014;animal tracks on the frozen pond, an air bubble caught in the creamy ice inshore around the heron&#x2019;s branch, the number of trees deep he could count in the leafless screen of woods across the pond, viewed from the oak where they hung the towel. When the grudging days of early spring arrived, and the trees were fretted more with undergrowth, the views foreshortened, but there was more to report. One day in late April, he had taken her back a box turtle, patterned in a smart brown and yellow plaid, but built a little too high off the ground, like the old Volkswagen Beetle, to be aerodynamically sound. MacIver had put him on the quilt, and the little fellow had finally stuck his head out of his shell and taken a couple of steps, before pooping quite impressively right there on the bed. Margaret had given him the Scottish name of Archibald, and insisted that MacIver take him back to exactly the same leaves in which he had found him, with the added gift of a lettuce leaf for his pains. She died three days after that, on the first soft day that promised full-blooded spring.<br><br>As Margaret had feared would be the case, MacIver did not do well after she had gone. He let himself go, and he let the house go. He knew it was happening and he felt bad about it as far as the house was concerned, but he didn&#x2019;t seem able to do much about it, except fitfully. His concentration was gone, along with the object of his attention. There was a backlog of work due on the house; they had loved it and cared for it year after year, as it needed and deserved, but in the fall MacIver had persuaded Margaret against all previous habits to delay some of the chores to the spring; they should hunker down and enjoy each other quietly, without ladders looming and workers banging. She had been sick enough to agree, but the house was showing its frailty now quite markedly; it was no longer a matter of cleaning gutters, checking storm windows, and calling the exterminator to keep the termites at bay. The fabric of the house was sagging visibly on the eastern side, and he was sure it needed a new roof. And what else? He mentally checked off the items he knew about&#x2014;siding on the windward face of the house, boiler, always feeble, cheating him of more and more degrees against the thermostat (unless it was the cold, or the windows?), two sagging, buckled gutters. In the end, he did not call the contractors, because he did not want them to open up the house and tell him how bad it was. And he did not call them because he still did not want their banging, their company, or even their secret sympathy. Bereavement seemed to work on him as a kind of blanket allergy, making him edgy and irritable to all the outside world.<br><br>And of course it was reciprocal: the world receded on him. Even his own Blind Pool seemed to shun him as an interloper. The lens of the water, which had taken in a full orbit of creatures and their activities, their presence and their shadows, and held them for key moments for the two of them to share and admire, now stared blankly upwards, blind indeed. He could tell that his ability to focus, to fix on a detail and hold it, had deserted him, and the loss of it had weakened his grasp on the place. He did not really seem able to see what was happening anymore.</p><h2>Fairy Worlds and Workers: A Natural History of Fairyland</h2><p>The Middle Kingdom! Various times and peoples have given it different names. To some it was Paradise, to others Tir-nan-Og; Arthurian Avalon; Fairyland; the World of Immortal Youth; the Land of Heart&#x2019;s Desire. Where exactly is that country? Well, if God&#x2019;s is the world of creative power and ours the world of created objects, the fairy world is the land of life that lies between them, serv�ing as the bridge for their interaction. The fairyland and its denizens have long been the concern of poets, painters, and storytellers. Not only are these beings charged with the maintenance of Nature&#x2019;s household but with her evolutionary plans as well. Our recognition of them and their work helps their efforts prosper and helps the earth be carried forward in its evolution.

Fully grounded in sound literary and historical scholarship, the anthology takes a fresh approach to many canonical authors, and includes a wide selection of work by lesser-known writers. The anthology also provides wide-ranging coverage of the worldwide connections of British literature, and it pays attention throughout to issues of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation. It includes comprehensive introductions to each period, providing in each case an overview of the historical and cultural as well as the literary background. It features accessible and engaging headnotes for all authors, extensive explanatory annotations, and an unparalleled number of illustrations and contextual materials. Innovative, authoritative and comprehensive, <em>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em> has established itself as a leader in the field. </p> <p> The full anthology comprises six bound volumes, together with an extensive website component; the latter has been edited, annotated, and designed according to the same high standards as the bound book component of the anthology, and is accessible by using the passcode obtained with the purchase of one or more of the bound volumes. </p> <p> For the third edition of this volume a considerable number of changes have been made. Newly prepared, for example, is a substantial selection from Baldassare Castiglione&#x2019;s <em>The Courtier</em>, presented in Thomas Hoby&#x2019;s influential early modern English translation. Thomas Kyd&#x2019;s <em>The Spanish Tragedy</em> is another major addition. Also new to the anthology are excerpts from Thomas Dekker&#x2019;s plague pamphlets. We have considerably expanded our representation of Elizabeth I&#x2019;s writings and speeches, as well as providing several more cantos from Edmund Spenser&#x2019;s <em>Faerie Queene</em> and adding selections from Sir Philip Sidney&#x2019;s <em>Arcadia</em>. We have broadened our coverage, too, to include substantial selections of Irish, Gaelic Scottish, and Welsh literature. (Perhaps most notable of the numerous authors in this section are two extraordinary Welsh poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym and Gwerful Mechain.) Mary Sidney Herbert&#x2019;s writings now appear in the bound book instead of on the companion website. Margaret Cavendish, previously included in volume 3 of the full anthology, will now also be included in this volume; we have added a number of her poems, with an emphasis on those with scientific themes. </p> <p> The edition features two new Contexts sections: a sampling of &#x201c;Tudor and Stuart Humor,&#x201d; and a section on &#x201c;Levellers, Diggers, Ranters, and Covenanters.&#x201d; New materials on emblem books and on manuscript culture have also been added to the &#x201c;Culture: A Portfolio&#x201d; contexts section. </p> <p> There are many additions the website component as well&#x2015;including Thomas Deloney&#x2019;s <em>Jack of Newbury</em> also published as a stand-alone BABL edition). We are also expanding our online selection of transatlantic material, with the inclusion of writings by John Smith, William Bradford, and Anne Bradstreet. </p></p><p><p> Of the ten general editors, <strong>Joseph Black</strong> and <strong>Anne Lake Prescott</strong> have focused on volume 2 particularly; they are professors at the University of Massachusetts (Amherst) and at Barnard College, respectively. </p> <p> Our Editorial Team: </p> <p> Joseph Black, University of Massachusetts<br> Leonard Conolly, Trent University<br> Kate Flint, University of Southern California<br> Isobel Grundy, University of Alberta<br> Roy Liuzza, University of Tennessee<br> Jerome McGann, University of Virginia<br> Anne Prescott, Barnard College<br> Barry Qualls, Rutgers University<br> Claire Waters, University of California, Davis </p><p> <strong>Comments on the <em>Broadview Anthology of Literature</em>:</strong> </p> <p>&#x201c; ... sets a new standard by which all other anthologies of British literature will now have to be measured.&#x201d; &#x2015; Graham Hammill, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York </p> <p> &#x201c;With the publication of <em>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em>, teachers and students in survey and upper-level undergraduate courses have a compelling alternative to the established anthologies by Norton and Longman....

No, says sociologist <b>Janet Poppendieck</b>, not when stopgap charitable efforts replace consistent public policy, and poverty continues to grow.In <b>Sweet Charity</b>?, Poppendieck travels the country to work in soup kitchens and "gleaning" centers, reporting from the frontlines of America's hunger relief programs to assess the effectiveness of these homegrown efforts. We hear from the "clients" who receive meals too small to feed their families; from the enthusiastic volunteers; and from the directors, who wonder if their "successful" programs are in some way perpetuating the problem they are struggling to solve. Hailed as the most significant book on hunger to appear in decades, <b>Sweet Charity</b>? shows how the drive to end poverty has taken a wrong turn with thousands of well-meaning volunteers on board.</p><p><b>Janet Poppendieck</b> is a professor of sociology at Hunter College of the City University of New York and Assistant Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences. She is the author of <b>Breadlines Knee Deep in Wheat: Food Assistance in the Great Depression</b>.A magnificent work of engaged scholarship analyzing hunger in modern America and the private and public responses to it. Poppendieck (Sociology/Hunter Coll.; Breadlines Knee Deep in Wheat, not reviewed) deals here with the seeming paradox that ``poverty grows deeper as our charitable responses to it multiply.'' Amid the myriad problems of the poor, we have chosen as a society to focus on hunger. Private, volunteer responses have been vigorous and grown exponentially; today there are tens of thousands of food programs in the US, sponsored by organizations as diverse as the Boy Scouts, postal workers, religious institutions, and credit card companies. Clearly, we care, and Poppendieck does nothing to question the sincerity of such efforts, only their efficacy. She finds we have retreated to charity rather than confront the fundamental causes of hunger and poverty. Growing job insecurity in a time of globalizing and downsizing, reductions in the purchasing power of minimum wage and public assistance, andmost especially, for the authorthe unrelenting attack on programs and entitlements for the poor, have created an inequality in the US greater than at any time since WWII. Volunteer food programs thus attack only a symptom of poverty and at the same time contribute to this poverty. They do so by allowing us to focus our energy on immediate need; they sap the energy of activists who might otherwise devote more of their time to advocacy efforts on behalf of the poor. Finally, such food programs let government off the hook, allowing it to ignore its responsibility to foster a more just and equitable society. The author examines all of these themes in detail through documentary research but also through ``participant observation.'' She works in soup kitchens and food banks. She interviews food recipients in their homes and neighborhoods. She brings to life the interactions of giver and receiver, creating a stunning tableau of kindness and desperation. The most important book on hunger and poverty in America since Michael Harrington's The Other America (1964). -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Examine Abraham George&#x2019;s claims and the evidence for and against the veracity of his message. Sift through the testimony and judge for yourself.</p> <p>Just don&#x2019;t expect to come away unchanged.</p></p><p>On February 23, 2008, my life intersected with Abraham George's. That path-crossing has turned out to be one of those rare, once-in-a-lifetime, "Y-in-the-road" acquaintances which has affected every day of my life since. On that day, my rational mind and my belief system were jolted by the most incredible story I had ever heard, told by this Eskimo named Abraham George, from Manokotak, Alaska. He fervently proclaimed his story of having died, being taken on a journey to three celestial destinations, and then being reunited with his body. I had strong reactions to it--amazement, extreme skepticism, and strong curiosity.<br><br>Due to my life-long interest in the spiritual world, I was enthralled by it and drawn into a quest to determine whether what Abraham was claiming was true. I reasoned that if Abraham's story were to be found false, then he needed to be exposed as a charlatan and fraud.<br><br>If, on the other hand, his claims turned out to actually be true, I felt that due to the paramount importance of its content, the entire world needed to know about it. I felt confident, due to my prior graduate training in Apologetics, that I would definitely be able to determine the truth whatever it turned out to be. Due to my unique DNA of strong skepticism and equally strong penchant for truth, in 1975 I enrolled in and successfully completed a Master's degree in Apologetics from Harding Graduate School of Religion in Memphis, Tennessee. My purpose was to equip myself to be able to safely navigate the spirit world without being led astray.<br><br>The word "Apologetics" is derived from the Greek word apologia (literally,"to give an answer"). Apologetics is a philosophical study of the laws of logic, rationality, and argumentation in order to differentiate truth from error and to be able to effectively communicate truth with others.&nbsp; Throughout Chapters 9-13 in SECTION TWO--MANY POWERFUL PROOFS, the phrase "apologetic value" recurs several times and it is to be taken as referring to the relative degree of certainty and significance of that statement or claim being made. I ultimately made the decision to accept the challenge of putting Abraham and his testimony on trial. I committed myself to do whatever became necessary to follow the evidence trail wherever it led and to leave no stone unturned to discover the truth. That decision led me into an extensive and expensive research project including fact-finding travels to remote Alaskan villages to track down the key people who have been involved or impacted by this event and capture their first-hand testimonies. It involved countless phone interviews and procurement of medical records. My goal was to verify and document (whenever possible) every significant fact surrounding this event. I am truly grateful and honored to be the one privileged to write this book presenting Abraham George's awesome true story. It is my conviction that it is my obligation to share this astonishing and epic event with the world.<br><br>May you enjoy and be enthralled by your journey with the Celestial Traveler. But be advised--exposing yourself to this material could significantly alter the remainder of your life-journey --as it has mine and numerous others.In this book you will be taken on a journey to places terrestrial and celestial. The terrestrial journey begins in a small Yup'ik Eskimo village in southwestern Alaska. There you'll meet Abraham "Ipli" George, a rough-cut Eskimo who for 20 years held the notorious reputation of being the "town drunk." In 2005, while on a routine wood-gathering trip on his snowmobile, Ipli had a fatal accident. Then while being medevacked to an Anchorage hospital, he was stunned when he realized that the lifeless body which the four EMT's were scrambling to revive was HIS! Suddenly a dazzling unearthly being, brighter than the sun, materialized before his eyes. <b>At that moment</b> <b>Abraham was instantly transported by the celestial being on an astonishing journey to three celestial destinations: heaven, outer darkness and hell.</b> You will hear Abraham's extraordinary report of what he saw, heard, smelled and felt on his incredible journey. He returned to his body radically transformed, bearing a vital heavenly message to impart to mankind and possessing supernatural powers to confirm it!</p><h2>For the Killing of Kings (The Ring-Sworn Trilogy, 1)</h2><p><p>Howard Andrew Jones' powerful world-building brings this epic fantasy to life in <i>For The Killing of Kings</i>, the first book of his new adventure-filled trilogy. </p><p>Their peace was a fragile thing, but it had endured for seven years, mostly because the people of Darassus and the king of the Naor hordes believed his doom was foretold upon the edge of the great sword hung in the hall of champions. Unruly Naor clans might raid across the border, but the king himself would never lead his people to war so long as the blade remained in the hands of his enemies.</p><p>But when squire Elenai&#x2019;s aging mentor uncovers evidence that the sword in their hall is a forgery she&#x2019;s forced to flee Darassus for her life, her only ally the reckless, disillusioned Kyrkenall the archer. Framed for murder and treason, pursued by the greatest heroes of the realm, they race to recover the real sword, only to stumble into a conspiracy that leads all the way back to the Darassan queen and her secretive advisors. They must find a way to clear their names and set things right, all while dodging friends determined to kill them &#x2013; and the Naor hordes, invading at last with a new and deadly weapon.</p></p><p><p>When not helping run his small family farm or spending time with his amazing wife and children, <b>HOWARD ANDREW JONES</b> can be found hunched over his laptop or notebook, mumbling about flashing swords and doom-haunted towers.

Perhaps I could mention the way it tips its hat to Arthurian legend without becoming beholden to it, and how it put a smile on my face. I might even touch on how deftly the world was revealed, layer after mesmerizing layer. In the end, though, I suppose what matters most is the experience.

Hettena lives with his wife and sons in San Diego, California.Trump / Russia <br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><p><b>VLADIMIR LENIN IS OFTEN CREDITED WITH</b> coining the phrase &#x201c;useful idiot&#x201d; to describe the shallow thinkers in the West who did the Communist Party&#x2019;s bidding without realizing it. During the Cold War, liberals consistently lived down to the stereotype that they were Soviet dupes, too gullible and weak-minded to see they were buying the rope that would hang them, as Lenin put it. With each passing day, it becomes more and more difficult to avoid the conclusion that the current president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, is either hiding something when it comes to the Kremlin, or simply one of its useful idiots. Neither conclusion is comforting.</p><p>In the halls of Congress and in the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, investigations are underway to determine whether Trump or members of his campaign and administration colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. The answer appears more and more likely to be a resounding yes. A hoax or fake news, counters Trump, who peddles a shameless conspiracy theory that it was all cooked up by a &#x201c;deep state&#x201d; trying to stage a quiet coup and expel a president democratically elected by angry voters who sent him to burn the corrupt Washington establishment to the ground. The GOP-led House Intelligence Committee&#x2019;s 14-month investigation found no collusion; the Senate&#x2019;s investigation and the special counsel&#x2019;s roll on. Hyped by the press, diminished by the president&#x2019;s defenders, and analyzed by legions of armchair pundits and self-styled investigators, the Russia issue has split the country right down the middle, with half of all Americans believing that the Trump campaign did collude with Russia.</p><p>So divisive is this issue that it obscures the very real and very alarming fact that Vladimir Putin directed an information warfare campaign aimed at influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. This is grave stuff, not fake news, but rather the sobering conclusion of the heads of the FBI, CIA, and NSA, as well as Special Counsel Mueller&#x2019;s crack team of prosecutors. Acting on Putin&#x2019;s orders, Russian intelligence broke into the networks of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party and stole thousands of emails, which were then released to WikiLeaks. At the same time, a shadowy Internet group based in St. Petersburg, Russia, directed employees to pose as Americans online and use social media to help Trump&#x2019;s chances and manipulate the 2016 election.</p><p>The battle is engaged. America is under attack by a foreign adversary, and for the first time in its history, this country has not responded. With more attacks sure to come in the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election, government response of some kind is required, yet the commander in chief remains either unable or unwilling to do anything about it. President Trump rails on about witch hunts and hoaxes, and mocks the very intelligence agencies tasked with figuring out how to repel this assault on American democracy.</p><p>Despite Trump&#x2019;s pugilism, however, there has been one man he has not crossed: Vladimir Putin. Their relationship can be distilled to quiet admiration from afar. &#x201c;I think [Trump] is an experienced person, a businessman with very extensive experience,&#x201d; Putin told NBC News personality Megyn Kelly during an interview in March 2018, &#x201c;and he understands that if you need to partner with someone you must treat your future or current partner with respect, otherwise nothing will come of it. I think this is a purely pragmatic approach.&#x201d;1</p><p>Trump for his part has not been shy about his admiration for Russia&#x2019;s longtime president, whom he has called &#x201c;a leader far more than our president [Obama] has been.&#x201d; Just a few months before Putin&#x2019;s NBC News interview, Trump acknowledged his belief that Putin and Russia did not interfere with the 2016 elections: &#x201c;[Putin] said he didn&#x2019;t meddle. He said he didn&#x2019;t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. Every time he sees me, he says, &#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t do that.&#x2019; And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it. I think he is very insulted by it.&#x201d;2</p><p>Trump&#x2019;s friendly history with Russia stretches back decades, to when Trump Tower first began taking on tenants after opening in 1983. From the beginning, the Russian Mafiya made Trump Tower a base for their skulduggery, a trend that continued when Trump built his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. When that venture failed, and Trump spent the latter part of the 1990s bankrupt, he turned again to the Russians, hoping to sell them on a Trump Tower in Moscow. The Russian capital became such a favored travel and business destination for the Trump family that Eric Trump once quipped to a friend of the family, who reported it later, &#x201c;We have all the funding we need out of Russia...[W]e go there all the time.&#x201d;3</p><p>That affinity has long gone both ways. Russian oligarchs, criminal masterminds, and Kremlin-linked officials have been drawn to Trump and his properties for years. But prior to the 2016 presidential election, those connections, nearly all of them shady, remained behind a curtain. With Trump&#x2019;s candidacy came more audacious attempts by high-powered Russians to assist him in his run, by reaching out with numerous offers of secret back channels, dirt, and hacked emails. While this book does not deeply dive into some of the more recent examples (the Seychelles meeting between Trump and Putin associates to establish a back channel between the two presidents) or more obscure intrigues now being dredged up (Trump&#x2019;s phone call to Putin congratulating him on his election victory), it does lay out a comprehensive historical narrative of this relationship. The problem with this story isn&#x2019;t that there&#x2019;s a lack of material. Rather, there&#x2019;s far too much of it to go into every aspect in great detail, with new items of interest emerging at a breakneck pace. As I write this, news that Trump has dismissed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (via Twitter, of course) is making the rounds, only a day after Tillerson had broken ranks with the administration to blame Russia for the poisoning of an ex&#x2013;Russian spy in England. So is news that the Trump administration has finally announced Russia sanctions on the Moscow-based Internet Research Agency team for their election interference, the first time Trump, in his role as U.S. president, has ever punished Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. At some point, my editor and I agreed that, barring revelations like these that we felt were groundbreaking, we would need to cease adding new items. To write a &#x201c;definitive history&#x201d; that is still writing itself may seem ambitious, but what most people need to know right now is how all this was even able to happen. What this book represents, then, is a primer that accounts for all the essential information anyone curious about this subject would need to know about the Trump-Russia scandal, as well as many of the side-stories that have formed along its periphery.</p><p>The Trump-Russia story keeps advancing at such a pace that it&#x2019;s easy to forget all that happened in the first year of the Trump presidency: a former national security advisor pleaded guilty to federal charges of lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador; the president fired his FBI director, James Comey; the very next day, he told the same Russian ambassador in the White House that firing Comey relieved great pressure that the FBI&#x2019;s Russia investigation had placed on him; a campaign aide pleaded guilty to lying about contacts with people connected to the Russian government who told him that Russia had &#x201c;dirt&#x201d; on Hillary Clinton and &#x201c;thousands of emails&#x201d;; and we learned another campaign aide was the subject of a year-long secret surveillance warrant because the FBI suspected that he was acting as a foreign agent for Russia.</p><p>At the time of this writing, while the House has wrapped up its investigation, Mueller&#x2019;s investigation is ongoing, and there are many reasons to believe that we have a long way to go before any final conclusions are reached. The collusion narrative is far from dead. The evidence continues to build. Russian intelligence has an indisputable reputation for their expertise in the black arts of espionage, which has often been used to acquire <i>kompromat</i> (&#x201c;compromising material&#x201d;) for blackmailing. Trump&#x2019;s boorish behavior has made him uniquely vulnerable to blackmail and extortion, as was shown by the $130,000 hush payment made in the weeks before the election to porn star Stormy Daniels to silence her from speaking out about their affair. Members of Trump&#x2019;s campaign and his own son, Don Jr., showed a willingness to collude with offers of &#x201c;dirt&#x201d; or hacked emails stolen by Russia, a foreign adversary. There were numerous efforts, including some by Trump&#x2019;s campaign chairman and Trump&#x2019;s son-in-law, to set up private communication channels with politically connected Russians. This behavior deserves condemnation; whether it rises to the level of a crime is another matter.</p><p>At the very least, this behavior fits the narrative of collusion perfectly. It&#x2019;s certainly not the actions of the falsely accused. Innocent parties use the facts to show how they don&#x2019;t fit the conclusion. Members of Trump&#x2019;s team, when confronted with the facts, have reflexively lied, even to the FBI, and destroyed evidence, while at the same time attacking anyone who might hold them accountable as haters and Clinton stooges. Still, the questions persist. Why would a presidential nominee trying to appeal to jingoists in the reddest states in America be working equally as hard to stay friendly with the Kremlin? There has been no answer to this question.</p><p>Trump has emphatically insisted that he has no business in Russia. &#x201c;Russia has never tried to use leverage over me,&#x201d; he declared on Twitter. &#x201c;I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA&#x2014;NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!&#x201d;4 While Trump would have the American public take him at his word, there is much about Trump&#x2019;s businesses and his personal affairs that he does not want us to know. This, after all, is the first president to withhold his tax returns since Watergate. Trump also refused to put his businesses into a blind trust, handing the Trump Organization over to his sons, who have participated in varying degrees in his administration. People with stories to tell have been paid or ordered to keep quiet. Much like his campaign, the president behaves like a man with something to hide.</p><p>The material gathered in this book is based on more than 100 interviews I have conducted since Trump&#x2019;s presidential campaign began. It includes conversations with many state and federal law enforcement agents, some of whom have never spoken on this subject before. In addition, I have reviewed thousands of pages of court documents, business records, congressional hearings, FBI files, and other records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act to tell the story of Trump&#x2019;s murky business dealings to bring Russian money into his pockets. Some of this material I previously posted on my website trump-russia.com. As long as this investigation continues and more material is uncovered, I will continue to document it even after this book goes to press.</p><br>&#x2014;<p><b>ONE CRITICAL FACTOR IN THE</b> Trump-Russia scandal is the role the Russian Mafiya played within it. While various media outlets have touched upon these relationships, I have further detailed them here to give readers a chance to understand just how tightly this shadowy web of intrigue entangles. To provide a taste of what I mean, take the case of how two Russian gun rights enthusiasts worked their way into Trump&#x2019;s inner circle. It begins with Alexander Porfirievich Torshin, the 54-year-old silver-haired deputy of the Central Bank of Russia and former chairman of Russia&#x2019;s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. Torshin was a suspected boss of the Taganskaya Mafiya organization. A lengthy investigation carried out by Jos� Grinda, the famed Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor and b�te noire of the Russian Mafiya, found Torshin used his connections in the political, financial, and criminal worlds to help amass an ill-gotten fortune.5</p><p>On wiretaps, Grinda&#x2019;s team of Spanish investigators discovered that members of the Taganskaya referred to Torshin as &#x201c;Godfather.&#x201d; Grinda&#x2019;s investigators also overheard Torshin and a Mafiya-affiliated former oil executive discuss how to coerce a Russian bank director into approving the transfer of millions of dollars into Mallorcan real estate. Not only did Torshin have links to the Russian Mafiya, but he was tied to Russian security services. He served on the country&#x2019;s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a government council that included the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Russian intelligence service that succeeded the KGB. He was best known in Russia for leading the official inquiry into the 2004 Beslan school siege that left 334 dead, more than half of them children. Torshin&#x2019;s review blamed terrorists for the deaths. An independent review by the European Court of Human Rights contradicted that finding by concluding that Russian authorities overreacted by using tanks and flamethrowers to storm the school.</p><p>Torshin exemplified the typical corrupt politician who was more concerned with bettering his financial standing than bettering the lives and safety of his country&#x2019;s citizens. Where he comes into the orbit of Trump is a bizarre connection to the National Rifle Association (NRA), itself representative of a new breed of dupe for Russia: the useful idiots of the American right. Not long after Trump&#x2019;s election to the office of the American presidency, two <i>Washington Post</i> journalists published an investigation into the common cause between right-wing American movements and their Russian equivalents, including same-sex marriage opponents, Christian fundamentalists, and gun-rights enthusiasts. Among the individuals highlighted by the article was George Kline Preston, a Nashville-based lawyer who had a long history of conducting business in Russia and who kept in his office both a white porcelain bust of Russian president Vladimir Putin and a portrait by a Russian painter of George Washington.6</p><p>Preston&#x2019;s interest in Russia led him to Torshin, who had done some pro&#x2013;gun rights lobbying around Moscow. Wanting to help Torshin&#x2019;s cause, Preston introduced the Mafiya Godfather to David Keene, the NRA&#x2019;s president and former chairman of the American Conservative Union. Delighted by his new Russian friend, Keene published an editorial in his newspaper written by Torshin, who revealed that he was an NRA &#x201c;Life Member&#x201d; and extolled the virtues of the late Russian creator of the AK-47.</p><p>The following year, Keene traveled to Russia for a conference hosted by The Right to Bear Arms, a new Russian group dedicated to gun rights formed by a woman named Maria Butina, an attractive 25-year-old gun enthusiast with striking red hair. Having the head of the NRA pay a visit to their smaller, nascent, almost insignificant Russian counterpart was like Steve Jobs&#x2019;s famed 1985 visit to the Soviet Union where he hoped to sell Macs. It was &#x201c;like an answer from one side,&#x201d; Butina said.7 In 2014, Butina and Torshin brought a politically connected NRA figure named Paul Erickson to speak at an open forum in Moscow.

It was designed to be simple to learn and to provide effective results. Fairbairn published his book, Defendu, in 1926[2] (reprinted as Scientific Self Defence in 1931), illustrating this method and it is here that the term "Defendu" first appeared This confused early readers of the book, who assumed that the techniques within had been based mainly in the Eastern martial arts that Fairbairn had learned. Thus, in an attempt to highlight the originality of Fairbairn's material, the term did not appear in the 1931 edition of the book.</p><p>Fairbairn was called upon by the British to help train Allied troops in World War II. Fairbairn and others expanded on this system to create the Close Quarters Combat system that was then taught to the troops. This system was built on Defendu, but modified for military applications, rather than police and riot control.</p><p>The original Defendu was oriented towards self-defence and restraint, while the Close Quarters Combat system concentrated on rapid disabling of an opponent, with potentially lethal force. The militarised version of Defendu is described in the military manual All in fighting 1942, used as a supplement during WW2 CQB-training. This book was later published in a civilian edition, missing the chapters on bayonet-fighting and rifle sighting, under the name Get Tough! How To Win In Hand-To-Hand Fighting. As Taught To The British Commandos And The U.S. Armed Forces. Fairbairn's CQC-system is also described in Rex Applegate's book Kill or Get Killed.</p><p>Publications:</p><p>Defendu</p><p>Scientific Self-Defence</p><p>All-In Fighting</p><p>Get Tough</p><p>Hands Off!

For the present-day Din� this is a world of glittering technology and influences from outside the sacred land entrusted to them by the Holy People. From the Glittering World conveys in vivid language how a contemporary Din� writer experiences this world as a mingling of the profoundly traditional with the sometimes jarringly, sometimes alluringly new.</p><p></p><p>"Throughout the book, Morris&#x2019;s command of a crisp unpretentious prose is most impressive...His style is so low-key that he hardly seems to be trying to be &#x2019;artistic,&#x2019; yet the cumulative effect of these pieces is quite powerful.

Scott Momaday&#x2019;s The Names. With From the Glittering World, Irvin Morris has joined the ranks of great contemporary authors."-Telluride Times-Journal</p><p></p></p><p><p><strong>Irvin Morris</strong>, a member of the Tobaahi clan of the Navajo Nation, is Professor of American Indian Studies and English at the University of Arizona, Tucson.</p>The story of the Native American's struggle to survive in two worlds, Native and white, goes back well before the likes of Sherman Alexie, Leslie Marmon Silko and James Welch to Charles Eastman (The Soul of an Indian) and his predecessors. One of the latest to tell the story is Morris, a member of the Tobaahi clan of the Navajo Nation and a teacher at State University of New York, Buffalo. He opens with a Navajo creation story about how the Fifth World, the Glittering World, came to be. From there, Morris moves forward, blending myth, fiction and memoir to give readers stories ranging from the Navajo's tragic Long Walk in 1863 to a poignant tale of a lonely Navajo grandmother's struggle to reclaim her grandson from the world of the bilagaanaa (whites). Morris's lyrical voice, his sharp eye for detail, combined with lean prose, leads readers into the harrowing, tragic and outrageous land of the Glittering World. Here, the traditional world of Navajo clans, skinwalkers, hogans and other facets of reservation life clash with harsh urban realities encountered in places stretching from Hollywood Boulevard to a Gallup, N.M., jail cell. The stories are sprinkled throughout with Navajo words; this technique, though initially distracting, by the end serves to enhance the theme of the clash and combination of two disparate cultures. <p></p><p>Copyright 1997 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Turkish Phrasebook &amp; Dictionary 5</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's #1 phrasebook publisher*</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet Turkish</i></b> <b><i>Phrasebook &amp; Dictionary</i></b> is your handy passport to culturally enriching travels with the most relevant and useful Turkish phrases and vocabulary for all your travel needs.

Providing a tightly focused narrative and interpretive structure, Brian Pavlac covers the basic historical information that all educated adults should know. His joined terms &#x201c;supremacies and diversities&#x201d; develop major themes of conflict and creativity throughout history. &#x201c;Supremacies&#x201d; centers on the use of power to dominate societies, ranging from warfare to ideologies. Supremacy, Pavlac shows, seeks stability, order, and incorporation. &#x201c;Diversities&#x201d; encompasses the creative impulse that produces new ideas, as well as efforts of groups of people to define themselves as &#x201c;different.&#x201d; Diversity creates change, opportunity, and individuality. <br><br>These concepts of historical tension and change, whether applied to political, economic, technological, social, or cultural trends, offer a cohesive explanatory organization. The text is also informed by five other topical themes: technological innovation, migration and conquest, political and economic decision-making, church and state, and disputes about the meaning of life. The third edition has added new primary source projects, improved maps and illustrations to enhance the visual dimension, <br><br>Written with flair, this easily accessible yet deeply knowledgeable text provides all the essentials for a course on Western civilization. Conceived as a seamless, affordable overview, not artificially boiled down from a lengthier text, it can be used as a standalone for a one-term course or combined with Volume 2 for two-term course. A test bank includes multiple choice, true-false, and essay questions in Word or Respondus format, and presentation slides offer all the illustrations and tables from the book.</p><p>Brian A. Pavlac is professor of history at King&#x2019;s College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he has served as chair of the department and a Herve A. LeBlanc Distinguished Service Professor. He is the author of Witch Hunts in the Western World: Persecution and Punishment from the Inquisition to the Salem Trials; coauthor with Elizabeth S. Lott of The Holy Roman Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia; translator of A Warrior Bishop of the 12th Century: The Deeds of Albero of Trier, by Balderich; and editor of Game of Thrones versus History: Written in Blood.This book is the way to go for a one-semester course: a text that's full, but not dense. It's well-informed and intelligently written, yet still accessible. The big-picture approach combined with guided questions keep students on track, while the writing is lively, anecdotal, and illustrative--a nice balance of the forest and trees. The concise nature of the text makes it particularly suitable for online or condensed semesters.(Previous Edition Praise)--Christopher M. Bellitto, Kean University<br><br>Written with the skill of a novelist, this book guides the reader step by step through the process of what a historian thinks, does, and interprets. Chapter content establishes the foundation for each future chapter with carefully selected questions, key word definitions, and ideas in bold type. This is the best-written textbook on Western civilization that I have had the pleasure to read in thirty-five years of teaching.--William A. Paquette, Tidewater Community College<br><br>The book's conciseness and reasonable cost are very attractive. For a single-semester course that spans the three millennia, I preferred this book to competing texts, which are just too long, with too many 'facts.' Pavlac's writing is also a plus. His informal tone and his skillful movement from paragraph to paragraph give his work a readability that my students like very much.(Previous Edition Praise)--Robert Good, Mercer University<br><br>Exceptionally well-written, engaging, and accessible. . . . Pavlac includes useful diagrams and charts throughout. . . that break down complex information into visual and easy-to-digest parts. . . . Perhaps the most important attribute of A Concise History of Western Civilization is that this is a text that students would actually read and understand. For many history professors, the first and most fundamental struggle is getting students to read and furthermore to read critically. Thus, the fact that the book is one that students will read, become engaged with, and understand makes it a valuable resource to teachers of Western Civilization.

Schouten, an acclaimed natural history artist, has created 80 full-color paintings that capture the striking physical traits of these feathered dinosaurs. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of the lifestyles of modern birds and mammals, plus the extant scientific data regarding how these dinosaurs might have looked and behaved, Schouten has produced not only the most beautiful but also the most accurate visual representations of these animals in print. Equally important, John Long, a noted paleontologist and widely published science author (with some 24 books to his credit), provides an engaging companion text that places these feathered dinosaurs within the larger family of dinosaurs--for instance, outlining their relationship to <em>T.

Epidemiology as a discipline has evolved over the years from a relatively obscure field in public health and preventive medicine to one that has gained increased prominence in all the health sciences, including health education, health administration, environmental health, allied health, and nursing. This comprehensive, user friendly, and academically sound textbook covers the basic principles and methods of epidemiology in such a way that will appeal to a broad range of undergraduate and graduate students in the health professions. Beyond its clear, concise writing, <i>Essential Epidemiology</i> offers unique pedagogic aids, such as an algorithm to help students identify epidemiologic study designs, a discussion of problems students typically encounter in calculating and interpreting incidence rates, and annotated step by step solutions to numerical problems. In addition, the text introduces topics sometimes ignored in other texts, such as hybrid studies, the controversy surrounding the use of hypothesis testing versus confidence intervals, and the differences between rate and risk measurements. Helpful features contained in each chapter include: 1) highlighted learning objectives and a brief overview; 2) study questions and practical exercises; 3) bulleted summary to stress key points; 4) list of key terms, all boldfaced within text; 5) useful tables and figures to clarify important material; 6) boxed exhibits with engaging supplementary information; 7) sample problems with step by step solutions to illustrate essential calculations; and 8) easily remembered mathematical symbols to aid memorization of formulas.

Martocchio</b> <br> My interest in the human resource management field began while I was a junior at Babson College and in compensation, particularly, while I was a first-year graduate student at Michigan State University. I found myself wanting to practice in the field as well as become a university professor and researcher. I pursued both professional desires starting with employment at Cameron and Colby (a reinsurance company) in Boston and General Electric&#x2019;s Aerospace business group in Valley Forge, PA. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I advanced my education in the human resource management (HRM) field by earning a master&#x2019;s degree and PhD degree at Michigan State University. My master&#x2019;s degree enabled me to build an even stronger foundation in practice and my doctoral degree provided me with the skills to conduct scholarly research and teach college-level courses. Since earning my graduate degrees, I have been a professor in the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois, Urbana&#x2014;Champaign and assumed administrative roles as a Provost Fellow, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and Interim Dean. All the while, I have taught a variety of courses in the HRM field. These include compensation systems, employee benefits, employment systems (HRM and labor relations), HR planning and staffing, and statistics. I also teach the compensation and statistics courses online. For many years, I served as the faculty advisor to the student chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management at the University of Illinois during which time students earned Merit Awards and Superior Merit awards on multiple occasions.<br> <br> </p> <p>As a researcher, I have studied a variety of topics that include employee absenteeism, employee training and development, compensation systems, employee benefits, and generational diversity. My work appears in leading scholarly journals such as <i>Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Management</i>, and <i>Personnel Psychology</i>. I received the Ernest J. McCormick Award for Early Career Contributions from the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP), and I was subsequently elected as a Fellow in both the American Psychological Association and SIOP. Following the attainment of this recognition, I served as the Chair of the HR Division of the Academy of Management as well as in various other leadership roles within that organization.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2018, a study in the <i>Academy of Management Learning and Education</i> revealed that I am in the top one percent of the most influential HRM authors out of a total of 9,744 people. Besides writing scholarly articles and <i>Strategic Compensation: A Human Resource Management Approach</i>. I have two additional sole-authored textbooks:<i> Human Resource Management</i> (Pearson Higher Education), 15th edition, and <i>Employee Benefits: A Primer for Human Resource Professionals</i> (McGraw-Hill), 6th edition.</p></p><h2>Construction Contracting: A Practical Guide to Company Management</h2><p><b>The definitive contracting reference for the construction industry, updated and expanded</b> <p><i>Construction Contracting</i>, the industry's leading professional reference for five decades, has been updated to reflect current practices, business methods, management techniques, codes, and regulations.

By focusing on land, territory, and property, he deploys the concept of &#39;property formation&#39; to consider the ways in which Europeans and their Euro-American descendants remade New World space as they laid claim to the continent&#39;s resources, extended the reach of empire, and established states and jurisdictions for themselves. Challenging long-held, binary assumptions of property as a single entity, which various groups did or did not possess, Greer highlights the diversity of indigenous and Euro-American property systems in the early modern period. The book&#39;s geographic scope, comparative dimension, and placement of indigenous people on an equal plane with Europeans makes it unlike any previous study of early colonization and contact in the Americas.</p><p>Allan Greer examines the processes by which forms of land tenure emerged and natives were dispossessed from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries in Mexico, New England, and French Canada.

That record held for more than a decade, until the car culture swept the U.S.</p> <p>Hot-rodders and drag racers built and souped up racers using car engines, piston aircraft engines and, eventually, jet engines. For this determined and dedicated group, the LSR was no longer an honor to be held by rich aristocrats with industrial backing -- it was brought stateside.</p> <p>In the summer of 1960, the contest moved into overdrive, with eight men contending for the record on Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats. Some men died in horrific crashes, others prudently retired, and by mid-decade only two men were left driving: Art Arfons and Craig Breedlove. By 1965, Arfons and Breedlove had walked away from some of the most spectacular wipeouts in motor sport history and pushed the record up to 400, then 500, then 600 miles per hour. <i><b>Speed Duel</b></i> is the fast-paced history of their rivalry.</p> <p>Despite the abundant heart-stopping action, <b><i>Speed Duel</i></b> is foremost a human drama.

Hawley really captures the drama of the race to the LSR, which included multiple sub plots wrought with tragedy...hope, innovative engineering, high finance...and more. He also gives real insight into the motivation of the key players, especially Arfons and Breedlove, creating dramatic tension that non-fiction books often lack... I guarantee you'll be captivated by the book. (<i>Canadian Hot Rods</i> 2010-10-07)<br><br>(4/4 stars) Hawley, a Canadian historian, brings the highest standards to bear on the often-told but still inspiring story of the land speed record battles of the 1960s.

Wilson <i>AutoWeek</i> 2010-11-22)<br><br>[Speed Duel] is written in an easy, but informative style which focuses on the personalities of the story, and the LSR attempts [Hawley] writes about only provides the backdrop for the struggle of those who wanted to do more than anyone else... There is plenty of drama in Hawley's book. "It's a quintessential American tale in the tradition of The Right Stuff," he said, "except that it is not about extraordinary men doing great things in a huge government program. It's about ordinary men doing extraordinary things in their backyards." Speed Duel is 360 pages in length, illustrated and would make a worthwhile present for that motorhead on your Christmas list. (Tim Miller <i>Hamilton Spectator</i> 2010-11-27)<br><br>[starred review] In the 1960s, young American hot-rodders, working in garages and backyards, mounted a challenge to the World Land Speed Record (LSR) long held by gentlemen British racers like Malcolm Campbell and John Cobb. Best known among them was Craig Breedlove, a movie-star-handsome young Californian with his "Spirit of America" jet-powered car. Chief challenger was Art Arfons, a drag racer from rural Ohio in his "Green Monster." Also in pursuit of the record were Walt Arfons, Art's estranged brother; Athol Graham in his homemade "City of Salt Lake"; and Nathan Ostich, a doctor who designed and drove his "Flying Caduceus" as a hobby. Hawley captures the seat-of-the-pants excitement and terror of crashes at 600 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats. This well-told overview of the car culture of the 1960s, with photos of the legends of the LSR, is a gripping read that will provide a jet-fueled adrenaline rush to racing fans and readers who enjoy social history in the style of Mark<br> Kurlansky and Erik Larson. (Susan Belsky <i>Library Journal</i> 2010-11-15)<br><br>Even readers who don't know a spark plug from a gear shift will be transfixed by Hawley's white-knuckled account of the ever-escalating competition to hold the Land Speed Record in the '60s and early '70s. Drawing from countless articles, profiles, documentaries, and interviews with the men and women who were there, Hawley traces the sport's evolution from its first four-wheeled record of 39mph in 1898, to today's jet-propelled 700mph-plus, recounting the creation, testing, and repair of legendary cars like the humble Green Monster and the charismatic Spirit of America. Deft reporting and an eye for detail put readers in the cockpit when drivers like Art Arfons hit 600mph and on the sidelines when Glenn Leasher's crew helplessly watches him crash at 400mph... Gearheads will likely devour this book, but anyone who's ever sat behind a wheel and wondered what it would feel like to floor it will find this cinematic account difficult to put down.

Despite the widespread popular interest in research into local and family history there has been no recent textbook to help the beginner to cope with the great barrier preventing access to that wealth of information&#x2014;medieval Latin. This book remedies the omission. It embodies the author&#x2019;s experience as a university teacher of Latin and local history over&nbsp;20 years, deriving from the notes and material developed for the Latin examination in the local history certificate courses which he organized. After dealing with the basic grammar of Latin, this very practical book examines the structure and vocabulary of the records use in local and family research, including Episcopal visitation, church court records, sepulchral inscriptions, wills, manorial court rolls, charters, and deeds. A final chapter explains the abbreviations used in medieval Latin. The book is complete in itself and contains al the necessary tables of declensions and conjugations plus a glossary of more than 800 words. The book is uniquely user-friendly, as the pace of instruction is never rushed, and&nbsp;the passages for translation are carefully graded for grammar and vocabulary and selected both for their intrinsic interest and for their representative character.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. </p> <p>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard. </p><p>It was a source of great satisfaction to Joseph Herriard that the holly trees were in full berry. He seemed to find in this circumstance an assurance that the projected reunion of the family would be a success. For days past he had been bringing prickly sprigs into the house, his rosy countenance beaming with pleasure, and his white locks (worn rather long, and grandly waving) ruffled by the December winds.</p> <p>'Just look at the berries!' he would say, thrusting his sprigs under Nathaniel's nose, laying them on Maud's card-table.</p> <p>'Very pretty, dear,' Maud said, her flattened voice divesting her words of even the smallest vestige of enthusiasm.</p> <p>'Take the damned thing away!' growled Nathaniel. 'I hate holly!' </p> <p>But neither the apathy of his wife nor the disapproval of his elder brother could damp Joseph's childlike enjoyment of the Festive Season. When a leaden sky heralded the advent of snow, he began to talk about old-fashioned Christmases, and to liken Lexham Manor to Dingley Dell.</p> <p>In point of fact, there was no more resemblance between the two houses than between Mr Wardle and Nathaniel Herriard. </p> <p>Lexham was a Tudor manor house, considerably enlarged, but retaining enough of its original character to make it one of the show-places of the neighbourhood. It was not a family seat of long standing, Nathaniel, who was a wealthy man (he had been an importer from the East Indies), having purchased it a few years before his retirement from an active share in his flourishing business. His niece, Paula Herriard, who did not like the Manor, could not imagine what should have induced an old bachelor to saddle himself with such a place, unless &#x2013; hopefully &#x2013; he meant to leave it to Stephen, her brother. In which case, she added, it was a pity that Stephen, who did like the place, should take so few pains to be decent to the old man. </p> <p>It was generally supposed, in spite of Stephen's habit of annoying his uncle, that he would be Nathaniel's heir. He was his only nephew, so unless Nathaniel meant to leave his fortune to his only surviving brother, Joseph, which even Joseph admitted to be unlikely, the bulk of the estate looked like coming into Stephen's graceless hands.</p> <p>In support of this theory, it could perhaps have been said that Nathaniel seemed to like Stephen rather more than he liked any other member of his family. But few people liked Stephen very much. The only person who stoutly maintained belief in the sterling qualities to be detected beneath his unprepossessing exterior was Joseph, whose overflowing kindness of heart led him always to believe the best of everyone. </p> <p>'There's a lot of good in Stephen. You mark my words, the dear old bear will surprise us all one of these days!' Joseph said staunchly, when Stephen had been at his most impossible.</p> <p>Stephen was not in the least grateful for this unsolicited championship. His dark, rather saturnine face took on such an expression of sardonic scorn that poor Joseph was momentarily abashed, and stood looking at him with an absurdly crestfallen air. </p> <p>'Surprising weak intellects isn't a pastime of mine,' said Stephen, not even troubling to remove his pipe from between his teeth. </p> <p>Joseph smiled with a bravery which prompted Paula to take up the cudgels in his defence. But Stephen only gave a short bark of laughter, and buried himself in his book, and by the time Paula had told him, with modern frankness, what she thought of his manners, Joseph, whose invincible cheerfulness no brutality could long impair, had recovered from his hurt and archly ascribed Stephen's snap to a touch of liver. </p> <p>Maud, who was laying out a complicated Double Patience, her plump countenance betraying nothing but a mild interest in the disposition of aces and kings, said in her toneless voice that salts before breakfast were good for sluggish livers.</p> <p>'Oh, my God!' said Stephen, dragging his lanky limbs out of the deep chair. 'To think that this house was once tolerable!'</p> <p>There was no mistaking the implication of this savage remark, but as soon as Stephen had left the room, Joseph assured Paula that she need not worry on his account, since he knew Stephen too well to be hurt by the things he said. 'I don't suppose poor old Stephen really grudges us Nat's hospitality,' he said, with one of his whimsical smiles. </p> <p>Joseph and Maud had not always been inmates of Lexham Manor. Joseph had been, in fact, until a couple of years previously, a rolling stone. In reviewing his past, he often referred to square pegs and wanderlust; and, that nothing should be wanting to exasperate Stephen, would recall past triumphs behind the footlights with a sigh, a smile, and a gently-spoken: '<em>Eheu fugaces!</em>'</p> <p>For Joseph had been on the stage. Articled in youth to a solicitor, he had soon abandoned this occupation (the square peg) for the brighter prospects of coffee-growing (wanderlust) in East Africa. Since those early days he had flitted through every imaginable profession, from freelance prospecting for gold to acting. No one knew why he had left the stage &#x2013; for since he had belonged to colonial and South American travelling companies it could scarcely be ascribed to the wanderlust that was responsible for his throwing up so many other jobs, for he seemed designed by nature to grace the boards.

In the course of little more than a hundred years from the day Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in his black ships, this insular, preindustrial realm mutated into an expansive military dictatorship that essentially supplanted the British, French, Dutch, and American empires in Asia before plunging to utter ruin, eventually emerging under American tutelage as a pseudo-Western-style democracy and economic dynamo.<br><br>What explains the seismic changes that thrust this small island nation so violently onto the world stage? In part, Ian Buruma argues, the story is one of a newly united nation that felt it must play catch-up to the established Western powers, just as Germany and Italy did, a process that involved, in addition to outward colonial expansion, internal cultural consolidation and the manufacturing of a shared heritage. But Japan has always been both particularly open to the importation of good ideas and particularly prickly about keeping their influence quarantined, a bipolar disorder that would have dramatic consequences and that continues to this day. If one book is to be read in order to understand why the Japanese seem so impossibly strange to many Americans, <i>Inventing Japan</i> is surely it.</p><p>&#x201c;Stylish and illuminating, <b>Inventing Japan</b> has the added virtue of being admirably concise.

After Iphi-geneia&#x2019;s mother, Clytemnestra, kills her husband in revenge, she in turn is murdered by their son Orestes with his sister Electra&#x2019;s encouragement. Orestes is pursued by the Furies and put on trial, his fate decided by the goddess Athena. Far more than the story of murder and ven-geance in the royal house of Atreus, the Oresteia serves as a dramatic parable of the evolution of justice and civilization that is still powerful after 2,500 years.<br><br>The trilogy is presented here in George Thomson&#x2019;s classic translation, renowned for its fidelity to the rhythms and richness of the original Greek.</p></p><p>Aeschylus&nbsp;was born of a noble family near Athens in 525 BC. He took part in the Persian Wars and his epitaph, said to have been written by himself, represents him as fighting at Marathon. At some time in his life he appears to have been prosecuted for divulging the Eleusinian mysteries, but he apparently proved himself innocent. Aeschylus wrote more than seventy plays, of which seven have survived:&nbsp;<b>T</b><i>he Suppliants,&nbsp;The Persians,&nbsp;Seven Against Thebes,&nbsp;Prometheus Bound,&nbsp;Agamemnon,&nbsp;The Choephori, </i>and<i>&nbsp;The Eumenides. </i>(All are translated for Penguin Classics.) He visited Syracuse more than once at the invitation of Hieron I and he died at Gela in Sicily in 456 BC. Aeschylus was recognized as a classic writer soon after his death, and special privileges were decreed for his plays.</p><h2>The Little Logic Book</h2><p><p>Written by four members of the Calvin College philosophy department, <em>The Little Logic Book</em> is a valuable resource for teachers and undergraduate students of philosophy. In addition to providing clear introductions to the modes of reasoning students encounter in their philosophy course readings, it includes a nuanced description of common informal fallacies, a narrative overview of various philosophical accounts of scientific inference, and a concluding chapter on the ethics of argumentation.</p> <p>The book features engaging dialogues on social, philosophical and religious issues based on the styles of argument taken up in the chapters. In additions to core concepts, distinctions, explanations, rules of inference, methods of assessment, and examples, <em>The Little Logic Book</em> provides philosophical commentary that will stimulate discussion of the assumptions and implications of various kinds of human reasoning. Free downloadable exercises are available from the publisher.</p></p><p>&#34;[There is] an impossible tension between high and low, from which we seem to suffer in academic textbook writing. . . . Textbooks--especially logic textbooks--are expected to &#34;talk down&#34; to students, in the sense of being undemanding, assuming no previous knowledge, explaining all terminology, and, in general, being suitably long-winded and patient. The Little Logic Book is refreshingly different. It succeeds in its demonstration of logical topics, from the most basic (like truth tables) to some of the most advanced (like modal logic and counterfactuals), and provides concise articulations of advanced questions and their no-less advanced answers. . . . This is an admirably pertinent book to supplement introductory philosophy classes by introducing students to the fundamentals of reasoning of all kinds?deductive, inductive, scientific, fallacious, and so on. When used with the exercises that accompany it on the press website, it will clarify these staples of philosophical argumentation in just the right dose at just the right intellectual level.&#34; -Anat Biletzki, Albert Schweitzer Professor of Philosophy, Quinnipiac University, review from Teaching Philosophy</p><h2>Satchmo Blows Up the World: Jazz Ambassadors Play the Cold War</h2><p><p>At the height of the ideological antagonism of the Cold War, the U.S. State Department unleashed an unexpected tool in its battle against Communism: jazz. From 1956 through the late 1970s, America dispatched its finest jazz musicians to the far corners of the earth, from Iraq to India, from the Congo to the Soviet Union, in order to win the hearts and minds of the Third World and to counter perceptions of American racism. </p><p>Penny Von Eschen escorts us across the globe, backstage and onstage, as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and other jazz luminaries spread their music and their ideas further than the State Department anticipated. Both in concert and after hours, through political statements and romantic liaisons, these musicians broke through the government's official narrative and gave their audiences an unprecedented vision of the black American experience. In the process, new collaborations developed between Americans and the formerly colonized peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East--collaborations that fostered greater racial pride and solidarity.</p><p>Though intended as a color-blind promotion of democracy, this unique Cold War strategy unintentionally demonstrated the essential role of African Americans in U.S. national culture. Through the tales of these tours, Von Eschen captures the fascinating interplay between the efforts of the State Department and the progressive agendas of the artists themselves, as all struggled to redefine a more inclusive and integrated American nation on the world stage.</p></p><p>Penny M.

Margaret Read MacDonald, an award-winning folklorist and children's librarian who is also a touring storyteller, offers basic start-up information on finding stories, looking at them critically, starting a "story bank," networking with other storytellers, and creating a storytelling event. </p><p>In chapters on learning and performing folktales, MacDonald offers the reader suggestions for finding his or her own performance style. Most importantly, MacDonald presents twelve fool-proof tales that will work for the first-time storyteller. Arranged in ethnopoetic style to relay a sense of rhythm, the stories encourage audience participation and feature enough repetition to make them easy to remember. </p><p>These multicultural tales selected from the folklore of Angola, Canada, Ghana, Nigeria, Siberia, Wales, and Zaire will delight any audience. Includes excellent bibliographies to help the new teller continue to explore the world of storytelling. </p></p><p><p>Margaret Read MacDonald Bio: </p><p> Margaret Read MacDonald is a professional storyteller, award winning author and highly respected consultant who travels the world telling stories and conducting workshops for educators. Her most popular workshop &#x201c;Playing with Stories&#x201d; has been offered in over 70 countries. She has been invited to storytelling and literary festivals in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Cuba, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and Singapore. In addition, Dr. MacDonald teaches storytelling to classroom teachers for the Lesley University Creative Education through the Arts program. For years, she also taught storytelling as an Adjunct Professor with the University of Washington Information School. Dr. MacDonald is the author of over 60 books on folklore and storytelling topics, including many award winning folktale picture books. She has been telling stories since 1964 in her work as a children's librarian, and she holds a Ph.D. in Folklore from Indiana University along with an M.Ed.EC. (Educational Communications Masters) from the University of Hawaii and a Master's of Library Science (MLS) from the University of Washington. She is well known for her ability to create texts that delight the ear and are easy for teachers to share. Teaching with Story contains 20 of these useful stories that can be used by teachers with their students.<br></p>Following her fine collection, Peace Tales (Shoe String, 1992), MacDonald here distills her extensive storytelling experience into 16 very brief, schematically organized chapters. Her advice covers the practical ground, from selection, learning (in one hour!), performance, and setting to classroom applications. Her philosophy of telling is simple: "Do it!" A confidence-building coach, MacDonald conveys the value of storytelling in an infectious manner. A dozen texts of proven success follow, with performance tips and source notes. Equally valuable are the selected and annotated bibliographies appended to every chapter. This straightforward volume would be a handy reference even for veterans. Few readers will be able to encounter MacDonald's encouraging advocacy without feeling an urge to find a story and audience of their own.<br><i>- Patricia Dooley, Univ. of Washington Lib.

My dad and uncle had owned San Francisco&#x2019;s Bi-Rite Market since the 1960s, which for me meant a childhood spent stocking shelves, helping out, and generally serving as free labor. Starting at the young age of six, I would go home after school every day, pick up the dinner that my mom had prepared for me and my dad, and head over to the market, where I would work until the store closed at 9 p.m. The grocery business was hardly my idea of fun, and as soon as I left home I didn&#x2019;t look back.<br><br>I found my calling in the restaurant world. I went to culinary school, cooked in Switzerland for a year, and continued to cook once I returned to San Francisco. I loved cooking, and I didn&#x2019;t miss the grocery business at all. So in 1997, when my dad gave me the opportunity to take over the family grocery business, I initially said, &#x201c;No way.&#x201d; At the very least, I was hell-bent on doing something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;other than running a market.<br><br>Still, Dad&#x2019;s offer piqued my interest. Just like him, I had entrepreneurial blood running through my veins, and at the age of twenty-nine was coming off of six years of owning and operating my own restaurant. With his offer, I immediately started visualizing the store&#x2019;s potential as a restaurant space. I fantasized about gutting the store to put in a large kitchen and a spacious dining room. Dad nipped that in the bud, though. He knew how hard I had been working at my restaurant&#x2014;the long hours, the less-than-healthy lifestyle&#x2014;and he denied me flat out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never have a family if you stay in that business,&#x201d; he warned. (Like many fathers of childbearing-age adults, he was pushing hard for grandchildren. Which he eventually got.)<br><br>So no restaurant. I still refused to do a grocery store, so we began to think about other ways to use the space. We entertained all kinds of ideas; someone even suggested to Dad that we open a pet food store, so we kicked that around for about a week. After much debate and no ideas that really excited me, I caved. I agreed to take over the market and continue to run it as such, but under one condition: I had to do it my way.<br><br><b>The odds were against us.</b>&nbsp;At that time, the neighborhood was hardly the trendy, vivacious, bursting-with-energy place it is today. The Mission has always been lively, but for a long time it was the wrong kind of liveliness. Dolores Park, just half a block from the Market, was home to junkies. Stabbings and shootings happened regularly. By the time I was twelve, I had been mugged twice on my way to and from the store.<br><br>Still, when we started our renovations in November 1997, one of the first things we did was take down the metal bars that covered the windows. What a drama that was! All these old-timers&#x2014;people we hadn&#x2019;t seen in years&#x2014;came around and asked, &#x201c;What are you doing? Are you crazy?&#x201d; To me, those bars made the store feel like a fortress. I wanted the store to look inviting and welcoming, so I told myself (and those questioning bystanders), &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking the bars off, and I&#x2019;m just going to deal with it.&#x201d;<br><br>The renovated store reopened on June 8, 1998. And it was crazy. My brother Raphael and I were partners in the business (he is no longer a partner but still works at the store), supported by six staff from my old restaurant and all the family members we could corral. I wore many hats in those days: I would go to the produce market in the morning, come back and cook for the deli, stock the shelves, and ring on the register.<br><br><b>In the beginning, we had no idea what we were doing.</b>&nbsp;We made it up as we went along, running it like a restaurant, which turned out to be a huge advantage. And, it turns out, we reinvented the grocery store in the process.<br><br><b>I did know one thing from the very beginning.</b>&nbsp;Coming from the restaurant world, I understood the importance of making things entertaining and treating the market as a theater of sorts. The flattering lighting, the upbeat music, the open kitchen and exuberant signage are all designed to create an energetic, fun vibe. I also knew that having friendly, informed staff would be key. So we hired former waiters for our &#x201c;front of house&#x201d; staff, and we expected them to know our food inside and out, just as they would at a restaurant. Even if they&#x2019;re stocking shelves, their main role is always to inspire customers, put them at ease, and get them excited about good food. All with the overarching goal of making grocery shopping an interactive, fun, and enjoyable experience.<br><br><b>The product selection got a makeover, too.</b>&nbsp;We revamped the offerings and got rid of products that my dad and uncle had carried for years&#x2014;things like cigarettes and forties of malt liquor. It came as a big shock to some folks in the neighborhood. After we reopened, people would come in, take a look around, and eventually ask, &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you got smokes?&#x201d;<br><br>We didn&#x2019;t. We filled the shelves with things that I as a chef would want: pantry items like good wine vinegar and panko bread crumbs, farm-direct produce, and sustainably raised meat. Basically, it was a lot of the same ingredients I had used at my restaurant.<b>&nbsp;I preferred these ingredients because they tasted better</b>, not just because they were organic or local. That evolution came over time and happened largely because of the people around me. These were people&#x2014;mostly our own staff at first, but more and more guests as well&#x2014;who wanted to make a difference in the world, and they began to push me in ways that nobody had before. Our produce buyer, Simon Richard, had a huge impact on me. A farmer himself, he helped me see farming in a new way, and I gradually understood why organic and sustainably raised produce was so important. I owe him a lot for that.<br><br>Once I made the connection&#x2014;that&nbsp;<i>where</i>&nbsp;produce is grown,&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;it&#x2019;s grown, and<i>who</i>&nbsp;is behind it are all just as important as flavor&#x2014;it was easy to apply that thinking to all our products. It eventually evolved into a rigorous but informal set of criteria for everything we sold:&nbsp;<i>Would we eat this ourselves? Would we feed it to our children? How was this raised, grown, or made? What was the impact on the environment? How are the workers treated? Can we feel good about that?</i><br><br>Often, the only way to answer these questions was to talk to the producers themselves. Not many grocers can say they are on a first-name basis with the people behind the products on their shelves, but we can. In addition, since we support so many local products, it&#x2019;s possible to visit the producer and see firsthand how the products are grown or raised. We also taste nearly every product before deciding whether to sell it. Even meat, cheese, or bread with the most pristine provenance will not get very far with us if it doesn&#x2019;t taste good. This process of evaluating and vetting products means everything that&#x2019;s here is here for a reason. The products support each other and enable cooks to achieve their vision. This alone has done a lot to establish a sense of trust between us and our guests, because they know that if we carry it, it&#x2019;s going to be good.&nbsp;<br><br>When we started making these changes, some guests grumbled about the higher prices that came with these more sustainable foods. We tried to help them understand the factors behind those price tags, including the lower yields (but higher quality) associated with organic farming. We worked hard to instill the idea that every grocery purchase affects the environment, the economy, and the well-being of the people who feed us. We talked about the true cost of food, including the hidden costs of subsidies (paid for by our taxes) and health care. In short, we all have the power to either contribute to the problem or be part of the solution. We&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;have the opportunity to make an impact every time we eat.<br><br><b>We&#x2019;re about more than &#x201c;service with a smile.&#x201d;</b>&nbsp;Although we have always prioritized hiring friendly, personable staff, to me, that&#x2019;s just a small part of our customer service strategy. We treat customers like they&#x2019;re visitors in our own home; in fact, we refer to them as &#x201c;guests.&#x201d; And rather than thinking about customer service as something limited to our frontline staff, we consider our guests in just about every decision we make. We&#x2019;re a&nbsp;<i>customer-directed business</i>.<br><br>This, again, goes back to the fact that at the beginning, we didn&#x2019;t know what we were doing. We knew we had reincarnated the market into the kind of place where we&#x2019;d want to shop. But what about everyone else? For this reason, we knew it would be especially important to keep an ear to the ground&#x2014;to listen and respond to guest requests, whether big or small. Other-wise, we&#x2019;d have no way of knowing that there was demand for gluten-free cookies or additional bicycle parking. Constantly listening to guests, and constantly evolving in response to them, has been the number one key to our success.<br><br><b>There&#x2019;s always more to learn.</b>&nbsp;Education goes hand in hand with great guest service. That means constantly pushing ourselves to learn more and dig deeper about the products we sell. We regularly take our staff on field trips to farms, dairies, slaughterhouses, breweries, and more. The payoff is huge: not only does it give our staff a sense of how good food is produced, but also once they&#x2019;re back at the store they can say to guests, &#x201c;This is how this is made, and I know because I saw it.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s pretty unusual in this business, and it&#x2019;s also a lot of fun.<br><br>Educating ourselves also means&nbsp;<i>doing</i>&nbsp;things ourselves. From day one, we&#x2019;ve produced our own sausages, smoked salmon, and p�t�s, which we sell out of the deli case. In 2003, my parents bought a farm in the former gold mining town of Placerville; from the orchard&#x2019;s fruit, my mom makes jams, jellies, and preserves that we sell at the market. We also started growing our own herbs on the roof of the store, and more recently we added a couple of beehives. In 2008, under Simon&#x2019;s leadership, we started our own mini-farm in Sonoma, just north of San Francisco, where our staff could actually get their hands in the dirt and grow vegetables. It&#x2019;s fun, but also helps our staff appreciate and understand how much work goes into producing food. It&#x2019;s an ongoing process; the more we learn, the more there is to know.<br><br><b>Educating guests is just as important.</b>&nbsp;All that work that we do to research and vet products is lost if we don&#x2019;t communicate it to guests. Telling the story of individual products is important to us. Sometimes we do that by chatting with guests. Signage is also important; we make our signs by hand and include all the key details about that cheese you&#x2019;re considering: not just the kind of milk and where it&#x2019;s from, but also what makes it special. In other words, why are we bothering to sell it? Why did we choose it? Why will you love it?<br><br>Tasting is another form of food education and the easiest and best way for us to share our own excitement about a product. We&#x2019;re constantly putting food into our guests&#x2019; mouths, whether it&#x2019;s a slice of American prosciutto or a sip of a great small-batch soda. We&#x2019;re known for our produce samples&#x2014;every day we offer precut samples of nearly every fruit we sell. It&#x2019;s especially popular with our guests&#x2019; kids, who turn out to be some of our most discerning and loyal guests; many are so won over by our fruit that they won&#x2019;t let their parents buy fruit anywhere else!<br><br><b>We&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;community.</b>&nbsp;Nobody is anonymous in our store. It&#x2019;s a lot like the bar in<i>Cheers</i>&#x2014;we&#x2019;re the place where everyone knows your name. We encourage our staff to build relationships with our guests&#x2014;to know not just who they are, but also what they like to eat, what they&#x2019;re looking for, and what kinds of foods are exciting to them. This enables our staff to recommend and share new discoveries and creates an interactive, long-term dialogue.<br><br>We&#x2019;re serving not only our guests but also the people whose products we carry. Some of our producers, like Ginger Balakian from Balakian Family Farm in Reedley, California, have been providing us with their amazing stone fruits since the very beginning. Others are newer. And when we find someone who&#x2019;s making something that people aren&#x2019;t familiar with, we&#x2019;ll go out of our way to promote it and introduce it&#x2014;passionately&#x2014;to our guests. We often invite the producers to the store to give out tastes and talk about their product. This gives our guests a chance to talk to producers directly, ask questions, and put a face to where their food comes from. We encourage our staff and our guests to think about the connection to the producer, farmer, or rancher every time they eat; we don&#x2019;t take for granted the hard work and dedication those producers have commited to feeding us.&nbsp;<br><br>It&#x2019;s not just about connecting guests with producers. We have found other ways to support producers, such as our unique arrangement with Soul Food Farm. As a burgeoning farm, they had the best possible problem: they had more demand for their gorgeous eggs than they could supply. To scale up, they needed capital. So we loaned it to them, repayable through a steady supply of eggs and chickens for the next year. Sort of like a community-supported agriculture (CSA, or &#x201c;farm shares&#x201d;) arrangement, but with bigger volume and a single customer&#x2014;us! And everyone benefited from it&#x2014;Soul Food Farm, our guests, and Bi-Rite.<br><br>Over the years, we realized how important it was for us to facilitate these relationships between our staff, our vendors, and our guests&#x2014;each one interdependent on the other for success. Our business was, in essence, a collaboration between these groups. We realized we couldn&#x2019;t imagine doing business any other way, so we eventually formalized it as our mission: Creating Community Through Food.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Everything changed.&nbsp;</b>Even in the early days, it was clear that we were on to something. The most obvious, easily quantified indicator was our sales. We set a first-year, admittedly ambitious goal of $1 million in revenue. We ended up exceeding that by 25 percent. By our third year, we did $3 million. After more than a decade, our business continues to grow by about $1 million a year. Our staff has grown, too&#x2014;our little original crew of six has grown to well over eighty. (First-time visitors, upon seeing the store, are often shocked to hear that we employ that many people. The store really is that busy, and we want to maintain a good work-life balance!)<br><br>The store&#x2019;s success has made it possible to grow the Market into a whole family of businesses. In December 2006, we opened Bi-Rite Creamery down the street to create a permanent showcase for the sugary talents of my wife, Anne Walker, and our business partner Kris Hoogerhyde. Our salted caramel ice cream&#x2014;an intense blend of sweet, bitter, and salty&#x2014;became an instantaneous hit; the line of guests eager for a cone wrapped around the block. In 2008, we started a neighborhood community center called 18 Reasons, an intimate venue that brings our community together with producers, activists, and innovators in the world of food. In bringing people together, we strengthen our bonds with one another and deepen our relationship to food. 18 Reasons has gained recognition across the city and nationally for its incredibly popular classes, art exhibitions, workshops, tastings, dinners, and lectures. A second Market and Creamery is slated to open by fall 2011.</p><h2>The Cat in Art</h2><p><i>The Cat in Art</i> is both full of surprises and hauntingly familiar, as cats play and pounce and sleep and purr their way through 170 great art masterpieces from the ancient world to the present. What cats represent to us in life, they bring to art: elegance and grace; domestic tranquility; symbols of sensuality and mischievousness. <br><br>Here are paintings by Van Eyck, Raphael, Leonardo, Bruegel, Rembrandt, Chardin, Gainsborough, Manet, Renoir, Bonnard, Gauguin, Matisse, Balthus, Picasso, Warhol, and many others. Sometimes the cats are the stars of the work, and sometimes they are working their magic from the corners of rooms&#x2014;in which case both the whole work and a detail showing the cat are illustrated. <br><br>Stefano Zuffi&#x2019;s charming text tells the reader what it all means, from the feline goddesses of the ancients, to the devilish cats of the Middle Ages, to the indispensable companions of our own time.</p><p>Stefano Zuffi is an art historian who specializes in Renaissance and Baroque painting. He has written numerous popular books about art and artists, including Abrams&#x2019; <i>Art in Venice</i> (1999). He lives in Milan.The cat is an animal of a "thousand faces," observes art historian Zuffi in this grand tour of the cat's various artistic incarnations. Graceful, devious, playful, luxuriating, fierce, affectionate, petulant, and aloof--in short, domestic without being domesticated--the cat has inspired artists for centuries. As Zuffi informatively and entertainingly traces the cat's evolution from deity to witch's familiar, an emblem of wholesome bliss to a rapacious hunter, a figure of comic relief to a model of poise and serenity, he presents uncommonly reproduced works by artists famous and less familiar, creating a unique feline portrait gallery replete with Roman mosaics, French illuminated manuscripts, Dutch interiors, Renaissance paintings, Japanese prints, imaginative works by Picasso and Klee, and sensual paintings by Gauguin. Cat lovers will delight in the many variations on the cat theme, while Zuffi's lively mix of aesthetics, history, lore, and interpretation turns the cat into a lithe guide to art history.

His murderer, never prosecuted, was a one-eyed former Civil War sharpshooter who made his living supplying exotic plumage for women&#x2019;s hats. At the time, an ounce of feathers was worth more than an ounce of gold. Bradley&#x2019;s death sent shock waves across America and helped give impetus to the burgeoning environmental movement.</p><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p></p><p><b> <p>Stuart B. McIver was a prolific journalist who also wrote numerous books, more than 500 magazine articles, and documentary films, for which he also worked as producer.</p> </b>In the late 19th century, McIver explains, as many as five million egrets, herons, flamingos, spoonbills, terns, cormorants and other species were killed each year in Florida, shot by plume hunters who often decimated entire rookeries and sold the feathers to the American millinery trade to decorate women's hats. In 1901, to save them from extinction, the American Ornithologists' Union, backed by the newly formed Audubon Society, persuaded the Florida legislature to pass a law making the killing of birds other than game birds illegal. In his carefully researched account of the struggle between environmentalists and plume hunters, McIver (Hemingway's Key West) tells the story of Guy Bradley, a reformed plume hunter in the frontier town of Flamingo, who was hired in 1902 as game warden of Monroe County and three years later was killed while trying to enforce the unpopular law. McIver spends a lot of time on details of Bradley's family history and on the changes wrought on southern Florida by the developer and railroad magnate Henry Morrison Flagler, a story that is important in its own right but adds little to the account of Bradley's murder. His killer, a plume hunter whose son the game warden was trying to arrest for shooting birds, got off scot-free because there was so little sympathy for the Florida bird protection law. McIver's story might have been more effective if he had spent more time looking into the lives of the Everglades' settlers and showing how a law that increased their economic hardship could lead to murder.

An anthology of texts and fragments woven together with an original commentary, the volume widens our understanding of the full complexity and richness of this period of radical thought and practice. The book covers the generational turbulence of Italy&#x2019;s postwar period, the transformations of Italian capitalism, the new analyses by worker-focused intellectuals, the student movement of 1968, the Hot Autumn of 1969, the extra-parliamentary groups of the early 1970s, the Red Brigades, the formation of a radical women&#x2019;s movement, the development of Autonomia, and the build-up to the watershed moment of the spontaneous political movement of 1977. Far from being merely a handbook of political history, <i>The Golden Horde</i> also sheds light on two decades of Italian culture, including the newspapers, songs, journals, festivals, comics, and philosophy that these movements produced. The book features writings by Sergio Bologna, Umberto Eco, Elvio Fachinelli, Lea Melandri, Danilo Montaldi, Toni Negri, Raniero Panzieri, Franco Piperno, Rossana Rossanda, Paolo Virno, and others, as well as an in-depth introduction by translator Richard Braude outlining the work&#x2019;s composition and development.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Nanni Balestrini</b> (1935&#x2013;2019) was a poet, experimental writer, visual artist and founding member of both the avant-garde Gruppo &#x2019;63 and the revolutionary organization Potere Operaio. <b>Primo Moroni</b> (1936&#x2013;1998) was a writer, activist, and archivist.

Among her other accomplishments, Susan created the sports romance.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>When Francesca was first placed in her mother's arms, Chloe Serritella Day burst into tears and insisted that the sisters at the private London hospital where she had given birth had lost her baby. Any imbecile could see that this ugly little creature with its mashed head and swollen eyelids could not possibly have come from her own exquisite body.<br><br>Since no husband was present to comfort the hysterical Chloe, it was left to the sisters to assure her that most newborns weren't at their best for several days. Chloe ordered them to take away the ugly little imposter and not come back until they had found her own dear baby. She then reapplied her makeup and greeted her visitors -- among them a French film star, the secretary of the British Home Office, and Salvador Dali -- with a tearful account of the terrible tragedy that had been perpetrated upon her. The visitors, long accustomed to the beautiful Chloe's dramatics, merely patted her hand and promised to look into the matter. Dali, in a burst of magnanimity, announced he would paint a surrealistic version of the infant in question as a christening gift, but mercifully lost interest in the project and sent a set of vermeil goblets instead.<br><br>A week passed. On the day she was to be released from the hospital, the sisters helped Chloe dress in a loose-fitting black Balmain sheath with a wide organdy collar and cuffs. Afterward, they guided her into a wheelchair and deposited the rejected infant in her arms. The intervening time had done little to improve the baby's appearance, but in the moment she gazed down at the bundle in her arms, Chloe experienced one of her lightning-swift mood changes. Peering into the mottled face, she announced to one and all that the third generation of Serritella beauty was now assured. No one had the bad manners to disagree, which, as it turned out, was just as well, for within a matter of months, Chloe had been proved correct.<br><br>Chloe's sensitivity on the subject of female beauty had its roots in her own childhood. As a girl she had been plump, with an extra fold of fat squaring off her waist and small fleshy pads obscuring the delicate bones of her face. She was not heavy enough to be considered obese in the eyes of the world, but was merely plump enough to feel ugly inside, especially in comparison to her sleek and stylish mother, the great Italian-born couturiere, Nita Serritella. It was not until 1947, the summer when Chloe was twelve years old, that anyone told her she was beautiful.<br><br>Home on a brief holiday from one of the Swiss boarding schools where she spent too much of her childhood, she was sitting as inconspicuously as possible with her full hips perched on a gilt chair in the corner of her mother's elegant salon on the rue de la Paix. She watched with both resentment and envy as Nita, pencil slim in a severely cut black suit with oversize raspberry satin lapels, conferred with an elegantly dressed customer. Her mother wore her blue-black hair cut short and straight, so that it fell forward over the pale skin of her left cheek in a great comma-shaped curl, and her Modigliani neck supported ropes of perfectly matched black pearls. The pearls, along with the contents of a small wall safe in her bedroom, were gifts from Nita's admirers, internationally prosperous men who were only too happy to buy jewels for a woman successful enough to buy her own. One of those men had been Chloe's father, although Nita professed not to remember which one, and she had certainly never for a moment considered marrying him.<br><br>The attractive blonde who was receiving Nita's attention in the salon that afternoon spoke Spanish, her accent surprisingly common for one who held so much of the world's attention that particular summer of 1947. Chloe followed the conversation with half her attention and devoted the other half to studying the reed-thin mannequins who were parading through the center of the salon modeling Nita's latest designs. Why couldn't she be thin and self-assured like those mannequins? Chloe wondered. Why couldn't she look exactly like her mother, especially since they had the same black hair, the same green eyes? If only she were beautiful, Chloe thought, maybe her mother would stop looking at her with such disgust. For the hundredth time she resolved to give up pastries so that she could win her mother's approval -- and for the hundredth time, she felt that uncomfortable sinking sensation in her stomach that told her she didn't have the willpower. Next to Nita's all-consuming strength of purpose, Chloe felt like a swans-down powder puff.<br><br>The blonde suddenly looked up from a drawing she had been studying and, without warning, let her liquid brown eyes come to rest on Chloe. In her curiously harsh Spanish, she remarked, "That little one will be a great beauty someday. She looks very much like you."<br><br>Nita glanced over at Chloe with ill-concealed disdain. "I see no resemblance at all, se�ora. And she will never be a beauty until she learns to push away her fork."<br><br>Nita's customer lifted a hand weighted down with several garish rings and gestured toward Chloe. "Come over here, <i>querida.</i> Come give Evita a kiss."<br><br>For a moment Chloe didn't move as she tried to absorb what the woman had said. Then she rose hesitantly from her chair and crossed the salon, embarrassingly aware of the pudgy calves showing beneath the hem of her cotton summer skirt. When she reached the woman, she leaned down and deposited a self-conscious but nonetheless grateful kiss on the softly fragrant cheek of Eva Per�n.<br><br>"Fascist bitch!" Nita Serritella hissed later, as the First Lady of Argentina departed through the salon's front doors. She slipped an ebony cigarette holder between her lips only to withdraw it abruptly, leaving a scarlet smear on the end. "It makes my flesh crawl to touch her! Everyone knows there wasn't a Nazi in Europe who couldn't find shelter with Per�n and his cronies in Argentina."<br><br>The memories of the German occupation of Paris were still fresh in Nita's mind, and she held nothing but contempt for Nazi sympathizers. Still, she was a practical woman, and Chloe knew that her mother saw no sense in sending Eva Per�n's money, no matter how ill-gained, from the rue de la Paix to the avenue Montaigne, where the house of Dior reigned supreme.<br><br>After that, Chloe clipped photographs of Eva Per�n from the newspapers and pasted them in a scrapbook with a red cover. Whenever Nita's criticisms became especially biting, Chloe looked at the pictures, leaving an occasional chocolate smudge on the pages as she remembered how Eva Per�n had said she would be a great beauty someday.<br><br>The winter she was fourteen her fat miraculously disappeared along with her sweet tooth, and the legendary Serritella bones were finally brought into definition. She began spending hours gazing into the mirror, entranced by the reed-slim image before her. Now, she told herself, everything would be different. For as long as she could remember, she had felt like an outcast at school, but suddenly she found herself part of the inner circle. She didn't understand that the other girls were more attracted to her newfound air of self-confidence than to her twenty-two-inch waist. For Chloe Serritella, beauty meant acceptance.<br><br>Nita seemed pleased with her weight loss, so when Chloe went home to Paris for her summer holiday, she found the courage to show her mother sketches of some dresses she'd designed with the hope of someday becoming a couturiere herself. Nita laid out the sketches on her worktable, lit a cigarette, and dissected each one with the critical eye that had made her a great designer.<br><br>"This line is ridiculous. And the proportion is all wrong here. See how you ruined this one with too much detail? Where is your eye, Chloe? Where is your eye?"<br><br>Chloe snatched the sketches from the table and never tried to design again.<br><br>When she returned to school, Chloe dedicated herself to becoming prettier, wittier, and more popular than any of her classmates, determined that no one would ever suspect that an awkward fat girl still lived inside her. She learned to dramatize the most trivial events of her day with grand gestures and extravagant sighs until everything she did seemed more important than anything the others could possibly do. Gradually even the most mundane occurrence in Chloe Serritella's life became fraught with high drama.<br><br>At sixteen, she gave her virginity to the brother of a friend in a gazebo facing Lake Lucerne. The experience was awkward and uncomfortable, but sex made Chloe feel slim. She quickly made up her mind to try the whole thing again with someone more experienced.<br><br>In the spring of 1953, when Chloe was eighteen, Nita died unexpectedly from a ruptured appendix. Chloe sat stunned and silent through her mother's funeral, too numb to understand that the intensity of her grief sprang not so much from her mother's death as from the feeling that she'd never had a mother at all. Afraid to be alone, she stumbled into the bed of a wealthy Polish count many years her senior. He provided her with a temporary refuge from her fears and six months later helped her sell Nita's salon for a staggering amount of money.<br><br>The count eventually returned to his wife and Chloe set about living on her inheritance. Being young, rich, and without family, she quickly attracted the indolent young men who wove themselves like gilded threads through the fabric of international society. She became something of a collector, dabbling with one after another as she searched for the man who would give her the unconditional love she'd never received from her mother, the man who would make her stop feeling like an unhappy fat girl.<br><br>Jonathan "Black Jack" Day entered her life on the opposite side of a roulette wheel in a Berkeley Square gambling club. Black Jack Day had received his name not from his looks but from his penchant for games of risk. At twenty-five, he had already destroyed three high-performance sports cars and a significantly larger number of women. A wickedly handsome American playboy from Chicago, he had chestnut hair that fell in an unruly lock over his forehead, a roguish mustache, and a seven-goal handicap in polo. In many ways he was no different from the other young hedonists who had become so much a part of Chloe's life; he drank gin, wore exquisitely tailored suits, and changed playgrounds with the seasons. But the other men lacked Jack Day's reckless streak, his ability to risk everything -- even the fortune he had inherited in American railroads -- on a single spin of the wheel.<br><br>Fully conscious of his eyes upon her over the spinning roulette wheel, Chloe watched the small ivory ball jostle from <i>rouge</i> to <i>noir</i> and back again before finally coming to rest on black 17. She permitted herself to look up and found Jack Day gazing at her over the table. He smiled, crinkling his mustache. She smiled back, confident that she looked her very best in a silver-gray Jacques Fath confection of satin and tulle that emphasized the highlights in her dark hair, the paleness of her skin, and the green depths in her eyes. "You can't seem to lose tonight," she said. "Are you always this lucky?"<br><br>"Not always," he replied. "Are you?"<br><br>"Me?" She emitted one of her long, dramatic sighs. "I've lost at everything tonight. <i>Je suis mis�rable.</i> I'm never lucky."<br><br>He withdrew a cigarette from a silver case while his eyes trailed a reckless path down her body. "Of course you're lucky. You've just met me, haven't you? And I'm going to take you home tonight."<br><br>Chloe was both intrigued and aroused by his boldness, and her hand closed instinctively around the edge of the table for support. She felt as if his tarnished silver eyes were melting through her gown and burning into the deepest recesses of her body. Without being able to define exactly what it was that set Black Jack apart from the rest, she sensed that only the most exceptional woman could win the heart of this supremely self-confident man, and if she was that woman, she could forever stop worrying about the fat girl inside.<br><br>But as much as she wanted him, Chloe held herself back. In the year since her mother's death, she had grown more perceptive about men than about herself. She had observed the reckless glitter in his eyes as the ivory ball clattered through the compartments of the spinning roulette wheel, and she suspected that he would not highly value what he could obtain too easily. "I'm sorry," she replied coolly. "I have other plans." Before he could respond, she picked up her evening bag and left the room.<br><br>He telephoned the next day, but she gave her maid orders to say she was out. She spotted him at a different gambling club a week later and after giving him a tantalizing glimpse of herself, she slipped out the back before he could approach. The days passed, and she found she could think of nothing else but the handsome young playboy from Chicago. Once again he telephoned; once again she refused the call. Later that same night she saw him at the theater and gave him a casual nod, a hint of a smile, before she moved away to her box.<br><br>The third time he telephoned, she took the call but pretended not to remember who he was. He chuckled dryly and told her, "I'm coming for you in half an hour, Chloe Serritella. If you're not ready, I'll never see you again."<br><br>"Half an hour? I can't possibly --" But he had already hung up.<br><br>Her hand began to tremble as she replaced the receiver on the cradle. In her mind she saw a spinning roulette wheel, the ivory ball skipping from <i>rouge</i> to <i>noir, noir</i> to <i>rouge,</i> in this game they were playing. With trembling hands, she dressed in a white wool sheath with ocelot cuffs, then added a small hat topped by an illusion veil. She answered the door chimes herself exactly half an hour later.<br><br>He led her down the walk to a sporty red Isotta-Fraschini, which he proceeded to drive through the streets of Knightsbridge at breathtaking speed using only the fingers of his right hand on the steering wheel. She gazed at him out of the corner of her eye, adoring the lock of chestnut hair that fell so carelessly over his forehead as much as the fact that he was a hot-blooded American instead of someone predictably European.<br><br>Eventually he stopped at an out-of-the-way restaurant where he brushed his hand against hers whenever she reached for her wineglass. She felt herself aching with desire for him. Under the intensity of those restless silver eyes, she felt wildly beautiful and as thin inside as she was outside. Everything about him stirred her senses -- the way he walked, the sound of his voice, the scent of tobacco on his breath. Jack Day was the ultimate trophy, the final affirmation of her own beauty.<br><br>As they left the restaurant, he pressed her against the trunk of a sycamore tree and gave her a dark, seductive kiss. Slipping his hands behind her, he cupped her buttocks. "I want you," he murmured into her open mouth.<br><br>Her body was so replete with desire that it caused her actual pain to let him go. "You're too fast for me, Jack. I need time."<br><br>He laughed and tweaked her chin, as if he were especially pleased with how well she played his game; then he squeezed her breasts just as an elderly couple came out of the restaurant and looked their way. On the drive home, he kept her amused with lively anecdotes and said nothing about seeing her again.<br><br>Two days later when her maid announced he was on the telephone, Chloe shook her head, refusing to take the call. Then she ran to her room and indulged in a passionate fit of weeping, fearing she was pushing him too far but afraid to risk losing his interest by doing anything e...</p><h2>The Life of Elves</h2><p>An inspiring literary fantasy about two gifted girls from the bestselling author of <i>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</i>, <i>The Life of Elves </i>sings of the human spirit and conveys a message of hope and faith.&nbsp;<br><br>Muriel Barbery's new novel is the first of two books about Maria and Clara, unforgettable heroines of a world facing annihilation.

Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children's book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975. Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. During this time, Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend and co-worker Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. Svenson joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins). The first volume in The Happy Hollisters was published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone, the first series written for and about African-American children. Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike. Children loved the books for their elements of danger and excitement geared to their comprehension level.</p><h2>Back to the Cabin: More Inspiration for the Classic American Getaway</h2><p><p>Dale Mulfinger is widely acknowledged as the foremost expert on cabins in North America.

The Nizitapi, or Real People, as they call each other, were people of the buffalo. They originated on the plains of today&#x2019;s southern Alberta, western Saskatchewan, and central Montana. Famed frontier artist George Catlin called the Blackfeet &#x201c;the most powerful tribe of Indians on the continent.&#x201d; Like many native people, the Blackfeet have stories and legends that originated centuries ago, perhaps thousands of years ago, and were passed down from generation to generation through an oral tradition.<br>Early explorers heard the stories directly from the Blackfeet and wrote them down. One of these writers was George Bird Grinnell, the famous conservationist and ethnologist who became a tribal member in 1885. Grinnell visited the Blackfeet in Montana almost annually for more than 40 years. He coined the phrase, &#x201c;Crown of the Continent&#x201d; for the nearby mountains and helped create Glacier National Park. He wrote numerous acclaimed books on Indian culture. The timeless legends and tales he recorded in &#x201c;Blackfeet Indian Stories&#x201d; make it one of his most enduring and entertaining books.</p><p>George Bird Grinnell was a famous conservationist and ethnologist.

Fitzgerald&#39;s new interpretation of Reconstruction shows how the internal dynamics of this first freedom movement played into the hands of white racist reactionaries in the South. Splendid Failure recounts how postwar financial missteps and other governance problems quickly soured idealistic Northerners on the practical consequences of the Radical Republican plan, and set the stage for the explosion that swept Southern Republicans from power and resulted in Northern acquiescence to the bloody repression of voting rights. The failed strategy offers a chastening example to present-day proponents of racial equality.</p><p>Michael W.

Omohundro Institute of Early American Histo)</h2><p>Recovering lost voices and exploring issues intimate and institutional, this sweeping examination of Spanish California illuminates Indian struggles against a confining colonial order and amidst harrowing depopulation. To capture the enormous challenges Indians confronted, Steven W. Hackel integrates textual and quantitative sources and weaves together analyses of disease and depopulation, marriage and sexuality, crime and punishment, and religious, economic, and political change.<br><br>As colonization reduced their numbers and remade California, Indians congregated in missions, where they forged communities under Franciscan oversight. Yet missions proved disastrously unhealthful and coercive, as Franciscans sought control over Indians' beliefs and instituted unfamiliar systems of labor and punishment. Even so, remnants of Indian groups still survived when Mexican officials ended Franciscan rule in the 1830s. Many regained land and found strength in ancestral cultures that predated the Spaniards' arrival.<br><br>At this study's heart are the dynamic interactions in and around Mission San Carlos Borromeo between Monterey region Indians (the Children of Coyote) and Spanish missionaries, soldiers, and settlers. Hackel places these local developments in the context of the California mission system and draws comparisons between California and other areas of the Spanish Borderlands and colonial America. Concentrating on the experiences of the Costanoan and Esselen peoples during the colonial period, <i>Children of Coyote</i> concludes with an epilogue that carries the story of their survival to the present day.<br><br></p><p>"A significant contribution to the varied and controversial literature on the evangelization of the native populations in California."-- <i>Missiology</i> <br>In this examination of Indian-Spanish relations in colonial California, Hackel focuses on local events at particular missions, places those events in the context of the California mission system, and draws comparisons between colonial California and other areas of the Spanish Borderlands, New Spain, and early modern Europe. He explores the incorporation of Indian communities into the missions, their demographic decline, conflicts between Indian and Spanish notions of marriage and sexuality, Franciscan religious instruction, Indian labor, mission-presidio economic relationships, and the Spanish legal system.</p><h2>The Glorious Soups and Stews of Italy</h2><p>Italian cooks are masters of the art of preparing simmering soups and stews that showcase seasonal ingredients at their very best.

On a rainy day in fall, nothing takes the chill off like a bowl of Crema di Ceci con Maltagliati, a hearty, rustic soup of pured chickpeas and pasta drizzled with fresh olive oil. In winter, La Genovese di Signora Venditti, a rich ragu of slow-cooked beef and sweet onions, will surely lift the spirits.

The collection is an extension of Pinknoises.com, the critically-acclaimed website founded by musician and scholar Tara Rodgers in 2000 to promote women in electronic music and make information about music production more accessible to women and girls. That site featured interviews that Rodgers conducted with women artists, exploring their personal histories, their creative methods, and the roles of gender in their work. This book offers new and lengthier interviews, a critical introduction, and resources for further research and technological engagement.<p></p><p>Contemporary electronic music practices are illuminated through the stories of women artists of different generations and cultural backgrounds. They include the creators of ambient soundscapes, &#x201c;performance novels,&#x201d; sound sculptures, and custom software, as well as the developer of the Deep Listening philosophy and the founders of the Liquid Sound Lounge radio show and the monthly Basement Bhangra parties in New York. These and many other artists open up about topics such as their conflicted relationships to formal music training and mainstream media representations of women in electronic music. They discuss using sound to work creatively with structures of time and space, and voice and language; challenge distinctions of nature and culture; question norms of technological practice; and balance their needs for productive solitude with collaboration and community. Whether designing and building modular synthesizers with analog circuits or performing with a wearable apparatus that translates muscle movements into electronic sound, these artists expand notions of who and what counts in matters of invention, production, and noisemaking. <i>Pink Noises </i>is a powerful testimony to the presence and vitality of women in electronic music cultures, and to the relevance of sound to feminist concerns.</p><p>Interviewees: Maria Chavez, Beth Coleman (M.

Yet there are relatively few books on the subject, and almost none for a general audience that combine expansive scholarship with lavish design. Making the Scene offers an unprecedented survey of the evolving context, theory, and practice of scene design from ancient Greek times to the present, coauthored by the world's best-known authority on the subject and enhanced by three hundred full-color illustrations.</p><p>Individual chapters of the book focus on Greece, Rome, Medieval Europe (including liturgical drama, street pageants, festival outdoor drama, Spanish religious drama, and royal entries), the Italian Renaissance, eighteenth-century Europe, Classicism to Romanticism, Realism and Naturalism, Modernism, and contemporary scene design. Making the Scene's authors review everything from the effects of social status on theatre design to the sea changes between Classicism, Romanticism, and Naturalism and the influence of perspective-based thought. Particularly intriguing is their rediscovery of lost tricks and techniques, from the classical <em>deus ex machina</em> and special effects in coliseums to medieval roving stage wagons and the floating ships of the Renaissance to the computerized practices of today's theatres. Such ingenious techniques, interwoven with the sweeping beauty of scene design through the ages, combine with the keen scholarship of Oscar Brockett and Margaret Mitchell to create a book as involving as the art it showcases.</p></p><p>OSCAR BROCKETT is the author of History of the Theatre, which has been the standard work in its field for three decades, as well as World Drama, Perspectives on Contemporary Theatre, A Century of Innovation, and The Essential Theatre. He lives in Austin, Texas.</p><h2>If You Want to Write: A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit</h2><p>For most, the hardest part of writing is overcoming the mountain of self-denial that weighs upon the spirit, always threatening to extinguish those first small embers of ambition. Brenda Ueland, a writer and teacher, devotes most of her book--published back in 1938, before everyone and their goldfish got their MFA&#39;s in creative writing--to these matters of the writer&#39;s heart. Still, the real gift of the book is Ueland herself: She liked to write, she didn&#39;t care what anyone thought, and she had a great sense of humor. You&#39;re simply happy to hang out with her.</p><p>In her 93 remarkable years, Brenda Ueland published six million words. She said she had two rules she followed absolutely: to tell the truth, and not to do anything she didn&#39;t want to do. Her integrity shines throughout If You Want to Write, her best-selling classic on the process of writing that has already inspired thousands to find their own creative center. Carl Sandburg called this book &#34;The best book ever written about how to write&#34;. Yet Ueland reminds us that &#34;Whenever I say &#39;writing&#39; in this book, I also mean anything that you love and want to do or to make&#34;. Ueland&#39;s writing and her teaching are made compelling by her feisty spirit of independence and joy.<p><b>BRENDA UELAND</b> (1891&#x2013;1985) spent many years living in New York, where she was part of the Greenwich Village bohemian crowd.

When a third vanishes, all hell breaks loose -- because she's the illegitimate daughter of Texas scion Clay Blackthorne and the granddaughter of his mortal enemy King Grayhawk. The crisis pits the two powerful families against each other in a race against time. <br> <br> Playboy Drew DeWitt, a Blackthorne cousin, insists on taking part in the search -- putting him on a collision course with Sarah. Her cop instincts tell her the sexy Texan is trouble. But when evidence emerges of a conspiracy against the U.S. government, Sarah accepts Drew's high-powered help as she negotiates a shadowy landscape of hidden rivals and ruthless greed where every moment counts in saving lives, including her own.</p><p>Joan Johnston is the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling author of more than fifty novels and novellas with more than 15 million copies of her books in print. She has worked as a director of theatre, drama critic, newspaper editor, college professor, and attorney on her way to becoming a full-time writer. She lives in Colorado and Florida. You can find out more about Joan at JoanJohnston.com.At the start of Johnston's swift-moving Bitter Creek romance (<i>The Price</i>, etc.), 17-year-old Kate Grayhawk, the out-of-wedlock daughter of Libby Grayhawk and Clay Blackthorne, skips out of her Virginia boarding school and heads for Jackson Hole, Wyo., where her mother lives. But soon after leaving a phone message for her mother, she's drugged and kidnapped at a Teton Village bar near home. Desperate to find her daughter, Libby phones Clay, the U.S. attorney general, and is surprised when he later shows up on her doorstep. Romantic tension sizzles between the estranged lovers as they recall their long-ago affair and the decades-old animosity between their families, but they put their differences aside to join Deputy Sheriff Sarah Barndollar in the hunt for Kate, which is made perilous by threats of avalanches and impending blizzards. A precipitous secondary romance between Sarah and Drew DeWitt, Clay's cousin, is complicated by the disappearance of Sarah's husband, Tom, 15 months earlier. But as the search for Kate leads Sarah and Drew to nearby Bear Island, Sarah discovers that Kate's disappearance may be linked to Tom's "abandonment." Though some elements of the protagonists' heroic search will strain readers' belief, the story's suspense and surprising conclusion nicely counterpoint the dual romances. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sredoje Lazuki&#x107; has been fighting all through it. Now, as one of the victorious Partisans, he has come home to Novi Sad. He visits the house he grew up in. Strangers nervously show him around. He looks up the mother of Milinko, his best friend. Milinko&#x2019;s girlfriend, Vera, was the daughter of a Jew, a bookish businessman. Her house stands empty and open. Venturing in, Sredoje is surprised to find the diary of the German tutor that Milinko, Vera, and he all shared, Fr�ulein, who died on the operating table just before the war.

His father, a Serb, came from a peasant background; his mother was middle-class and Jewish. The family lived comfortably, and Ti&#x161;ma received a good education. In 1941, Hungary annexed Vojvodina; the next year&#x2014;Ti&#x161;ma&#x2019;s last in high school&#x2014;the regime carried out a series of murderous pogroms, killing some 3,000 inhabitants, primarily Serbs and Jews, though the Ti&#x161;mas were spared. After fighting for the Yugoslav partisans, Ti&#x161;ma studied philosophy at Belgrade University and went into journalism and in 1949 joined the editorial staff of a publishing house, where he remained until his retirement in 1980. Ti&#x161;ma published his first story, &#x201c;Ibika&#x2019;s House,&#x201d; in 1951; it was followed by the novels <i>Guilt</i> and I<i>n Search of the Dark Girl</i> and a collection of stories, <i>Violence</i>.&nbsp; In the 1970s and &#x2019;80s, he gained international recognition with the publication of his Novi Sad trilogy: <i>The Book of Blam </i>(1971), about a survivor of the Hungarian occupation of Novi Sad; <i>The Use of Man </i>(1976), which follows a group of friends through the Second World War and after; and <i>Kapo</i> (1987), the story of a Jew raised as a Catholic who becomes a guard in a German concentration camp.

Her most recent novel is <i>The Woman Upstairs</i>. She lives with her family in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&#x201c;Aleksandar Ti&#x161;ma may appear to be writing yet another novel dealing with the Second World War devastation of Europe. He is not. It is an amazingly fresh and profoundly wise piece of writing. He brings the reticence of the scalpel to an examination of the nature of violence. He probes with clarity and detachment the secret areas of the human psyche where motives for violence are born. This is a seminal work of post-war fiction, and Bernard Johnson has produced not only an exemplary rendering from Serbo-Croatian, but something of a classic in English."&nbsp; &#x2014;Branko Gorjup, <i>Ottawa Citizen</i><br><br>&#x201c;Ti&#x161;ma&#x2019;s <i>The Use of Man</i> is a stunning book. I have seldom read anything that authentically conveys the feel of that nightmare&#x2014;the war, the Holocaust, the brutal aftermath, and the almost equally brutal dreariness of a provincial town frozen in time, caught between Mitteleuropa and the Balkans. The angle of vision&#x2014;call it compassionate detachment&#x2014;accounts for some of the impact, but the most impressive achievement is the range of characters.

Only the dead truly know this Bloodwood Forest.<br> <br>&#x2014;THE BOOK OF THE BETRAYER<br> CHAPTER ONE<p></p> CRYSTALWOOD<p></p> <br>22ND DAY OF THE MOURNING MOON, 999TH YEAR OF LAIJON<br> <br>BLOODWOOD FOREST, S�R SEVIER<br> <br>Screams broke the silence that shrouded the lush black woods. Savage cries that Krista Aulbrek gathered and shoved into that nowhere, bottomless part of her mind before they could take root in her emotion. This was her first time in this place of unique strangeness, this mystifying maze of hard-edged beauty and endless dark splendor&#x2014;this Bloodwood Forest.<br> <br>Krista led her mare by the bit. The horse was large, magnificent, and black; Dread was her name. Her nostrils were wide and huffing, ears back. Wariness from days of hard riding infused the horse&#x2019;s slow gait as together they padded through the velvety green blanket of scent and black flowers. The mare&#x2019;s eyes were a hazy red color&#x2014;a sign of the rauthouin bane Krista had been injecting into her young mount. Within a year those twisted eyes would flame like sparkling red jewels, and the mare&#x2019;s muscles would toughen and swell with unnatural strength. Dread would be a true Bloodeye steed then.<br> <br>As she and Dread drifted their way down a gentle slope of grass and dark trees, Krista&#x2019;s senses were ever heightened. Red butterflies fluttered from the lavish, mossy bracken at her every step. There was no deadfall here. Every tree was tall and thin and lanced straight toward the brassy gray sky. They were like the white birch of the S�r Sevier Nordland Highlands, only the bark of these trees was black as moonless midnight, every sinuous branch bristling with barb and thorn. Leaves of lustrous green webbed with red veins seemed to pulse and dance to the beating of a giant heart buried deep in the loamy soil.<br> <br>A thick, damp air crawled through the trees and dragged over the flowers as Krista and Dread reached the bottom of the hillock and saw their first prisoner, a middle-aged woman clothed in naught but a tan smock. She was facing Krista, standing with her arms stretched behind her around the base of a Bloodwood tree, hands cuffed in irons, chains wrapped around both legs. Her eyes widened at the sight of Krista and the large black horse. Her chest heaved in panic as she mouthed a silent No!<br> <br>Krista knew how she herself must look to this captive. Black leather armor, daggers strapped to her hip under crisp black sheaths, a black cape thrown over her shoulder. A sword and leather pouch were tied to the saddle of the demon-eyed horse at her side, the satchel full of poisons and tenvamaru. Yes, Krista knew a Bloodwood assassin was striking to behold. Especially one like her, flawless pale skin, long straight blond hair, bangs squared just above bright green eyes. Together, she and Dread looked cold, hard, deadly, and above all beautiful.<br> <br>Other prisoners soon came into view&#x2014;a hundred of them; men, women, a handful of Vall�, a mangy oghul or two. All were spread out behind the first woman. All were shackled and chained to tree after tree, on and on into the dark distance of the charcoal-bleak forest. All had been brought up from the dungeons of Rokenwalder for this Sacrament of Souls.<br> <br>The heavy wind stilled, and to the left of Krista, the forest shimmered darkly. A cloaked form materialized between the opaque depths of the Bloodwood trees, and the captive woman screamed.<br> <br>Confident and tall, face hidden in the shadows of his cowl, Black Dugal glided toward Krista like a malevolent mist. Sure was his step. Silent as snow falling at night, he seeped through the trees with an unobtrusive ease. His own massive Bloodeye stallion, Malice, was a hazy silhouette of grim darkness in the woods behind him, red eyes glowing, ever watchful.<br> <br>Dugal&#x2019;s raven-colored cloak flowed above the grass and spindly briar. As he drew near, the familiar landscape of his face came into focus. Chiseled nose; hard lips; gray-shot beard; and veined, red eyes&#x2014;all that was visible in the shadow of his hood. One deep scar in the shape of a crescent moon marked his left cheek; two others arced below his right eye and across his face to disappear under his beard. One shallow scar cut straight through his right brow and sooty eyelashes and up his forehead to become lost in the cowl of his mantle. Overall, Dugal looked sinister, tortured, and strikingly beautiful.<br> <br>Beauty was the first rule of the Bloodwood assassins.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you anything to say for yourself?&#x201d; Dugal stepped up to her.<br> <br>Krista always felt a certain thrill hearing the coldness of her master&#x2019;s voice. She met his radiant, penetrating gaze with confidence, knowing now with a certainty she had achieved this goal before Hans Rake, for Black Dugal would not have appeared to her had she not arrived here first.<br> <br>&#x201c;I reached this place easy enough.&#x201d; She did not break her eyes from his. Her fingers tightened, though, still fastened to Dread&#x2019;s bit. Her skin prickled with anticipation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three whole days it took,&#x201d; he said. Not a muscle in him moved. He had a way of creating tension in her like no human could. &#x201c;I expected better from you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite his words, she held her head high. &#x201c;I do not see Hans anywhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dugal met her statement with stony eyes. A sickly red light glared from those cold orbs. Blood of the Dragon! It was alchemy she did not yet understand&#x2014;sap of the Bloodwood tree mixed with some fell drug. Her master had not yet offered her Blood of the Dragon, as he had Hans Rake. In their first year of training, Hans had compiled more kills than her. Blood of the Dragon had been his reward. And a Bloodwood assassin in training was allowed to partake of the precious and rare drug only under Black Dugal&#x2019;s leave. Each year, a different reward was given to the one with the most kills. Last year Krista was gifted with Dread.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your name is now Crystalwood,&#x201d; Dugal said almost warmly.<br> <br>Crystalwood. She liked how it sounded on his tongue. Krista to Crystalwood. She was almost disappointed in herself for not anticipating it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see you approve.&#x201d; Only Dugal could so quickly adopt that intimate tone of a long-known friend. &#x201c;I had one who struck like a spider. Another who stalked like a hawk. One who moved like silk. One as charming as a rose. All of my making. All beautiful. Now you, perhaps my greatest creation. More bright and precious than a jewel. More sharp and keen than a crystal shard. You are my deadliest weapon of all. More lethal even than Silk and the Rose combined.&#x201d;<br> <br>Krista thrilled at his words. She pictured Silkwood and Rosewood; the two exquisite blond female Vall� of Black Dugal&#x2019;s Caste. Both had left on separate missions more than five moons ago. The two Vall� had helped Dugal train her and Hans Rake in the beautiful art of assassination. They had participated in many kills together. There had also been another teacher in the beginning&#x2014;Spiderwood&#x2014;an experienced but cruel-faced Bloodwood who&#x2019;d mimicked the traits of Dugal to an alarming degree. So exacting were his mannerisms, Krista wondered if he wasn&#x2019;t somehow relation to her master.<br> <br>&#x201c;Crystalwood,&#x201d; she repeated, feeling the name flow from between her lips.<br> <br>Dugal gave her a placid nod of affirmation. His eyes roamed the forest beyond, settling on the woman chained to the tree. Hints of sunlight trickled through the crooked branches and leaves above like whispers through a stained-glass window and lit on the woman&#x2019;s panicked face like gold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come.&#x201d; Dugal beckoned.<br> <br>Krista&#x2019;s heart failed a beat. She put her head to her mare&#x2019;s neck. Felt Dread&#x2019;s warmth. It always calmed her, this small thing. Helped her breathe easy. Then she let go the bit, motioned her horse to stay, and followed her master. The woman at the tree tried to shrink away as Krista and Dugal approached. Sunken flesh hung in wrinkled folds about her eyes, cheeks, and jowls. The captive&#x2019;s tan shift carried an air of urine and sweat. In fact, a musty, fetid stink suffused the entire area. And the distant shrieks of other prisoners echoed through the forest.<br> <br>Dugal reached one languid hand above the woman&#x2019;s head. He peeled a thin strip of coal-colored bark from the tree, tossing it to the ground without thought. Red sap welled slowly from the tree&#x2019;s wound. The curious sap sizzled and smoked as it crawled down the black bark. Krista ran her fingers over the surface of the tree. It was not flaky and brittle like that of a birch. It felt like moist leather&#x2014;like warm human flesh. She could feel herself shudder at the unsettling sensation.<br> <br>Dugal reached above the captive again, dabbed two of his fingers into the smoking sap. Tendrils of smoke drifted from his fingers, now painted in red. He stepped toward Krista and ran both fingers across her face, smearing two streaks of sizzling sap under her left eye. It stung. Krista resisted the urge to flinch away, focused on the confusion and panic on the chained woman&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>Dugal swiped more smoking sap from the tree. &#x201c;Show me your tongue,&#x201d; he ordered, his fingers coated in red again.<br> <br>Krista stuck out her tongue. Dugal touched the sap to it. Initially it burned. Then she caught its divine taste and immediately desired more, eyes greedily fixed on the wound in the tree and the crimson sap hanging there, sizzling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Part of your final test is to never partake of the Bloodwood sap again.&#x201d; Dugal&#x2019;s red-streaked, stone-carved eyes bit into hers. &#x201c;Even if I offer it.&#x201d; Krista felt great sorrow and longing for the sap before the words were even out of his mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Death is the father of terror.&#x201d; Dugal&#x2019;s eyes were now trained on the prisoner. &#x201c;?&#x2019;Tis what men dread most. Death. But there is such beauty it.&#x201d; He reached out and stroked the side of the woman&#x2019;s face with the back of his hand. She cowered away from his touch. He continued, &#x201c;The image of a corpse is graven into the mind of the one who sees it for the first time. That first time one sees death&#x2014;not the death of a doe or a dog or a skittering gutter cat, but real death, the death of a human&#x2014;is powerful. Name one other visible image as potent, as compelling, as full of beauty.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dugal turned his gaze to Krista. &#x201c;And here you are. Crystalwood. Ready and willing to administer more cruel beauty on this lovely day.&#x201d; She was always charmed by her master, even here, even conversing of sacrificial murder in a forest of midnight color and savage screams and divine burning sap. Such cruel beauty.<br> <br>He was right. Five years killing, of training in dance, acrobatics, games, puzzles, stealth, lock picking, key making, thievery, crossbow, alchemy, mixing poisons, knife and sword and spear and chain-mace had led her here, to this.<br> <br>Her Sacrament of Souls.<br> <br>She looked up at the black tree and oozing sap. I want to taste it again. With that thought, she looked away. Sweating. When Black Dugal had first presented her with the Bloodwood leathers, she&#x2019;d imagined they would be as uncomfortable and hot as a baker&#x2019;s oven. Yet that had not been the case. They were surprisingly comfortable. She had never once in five years sweated in them. Now she felt the odd sensation that the armor was somehow feeding on her flesh, consuming her like a blanketing parasite, infecting her with its sumptuous stifling caress.<br> <br>Dugal&#x2019;s eyes bored into hers, unflinching. &#x201c;You have already killed many in my name. You are brutal and efficient and unfeeling in your work. And that is good. But today will be different. A corpse, alarming to view at first, can become delightful to observe as a work of art. Especially when created by one&#x2019;s own hand. That is what you are to learn here today. The entire extent of human anatomy. Your final test. Murder in the name of art. The mother of all beauty.&#x201d; The woman trussed to the tree next to them started gasping in panic at his words.<br> <br>Dark gaze focused on Krista, Dugal continued, &#x201c;Before, you were simply a killer. After today you will be a true Bloodwood assassin. You will become Crystalwood. And with your new name, you must forsake your past. Rid yourself of whatever heritage you still hold dear. There is no more room for tenderness of heart. No room for the longings of the past. No room for love. Today you will learn the full art of what we do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Krista&#x2019;s stomach crawled up into her throat as her master went on. &#x201c;Your mother is long dead. You were raised by your father, Gault Aulbrek. You will never again let his name pass over your lips. You are now called fatherless.&#x201d;<br> <br>Loneliness was growing in her breast. Bitterness too. After her father had left for war ten years ago, she had grown accustomed to her miserable, lonely life with King Aevrett and his queen, the beautiful and dignified and cruel Natalia. For five years the woman had treated her as a slave, keeping her under the wing of Aevrett&#x2019;s own Knights Chivalric bodyguards at J� Reviens, the king&#x2019;s palace. And she had grown to despise Natalia for reasons she did not wish to think of now. And she had grown bitter that her father had left her for war and never returned. Left her with an evil king and his even more evil queen.<br> <br>Though she ofttimes wondered why Black Dugal trained her, ever since he had rescued her from the torment of J� Reviens five years ago and just after her father had left for war a second time, the world had become a better place. Less sensible for sure. Less secure, yes. But better. For there was freedom in the power to kill. And cold murder was a swift cure for bitterness. And now life was soon to become infinitely more unloving and brutal and rich. And that is what she had wanted. What she had worked so hard for these last five years. This moment. This Sacrament of Souls. The completion of her training.<br> <br>Neither Seita nor Breita were around to keep her company anymore, to soothe that initial apprehension she&#x2019;d felt those first few years under Dugal. She had learned much from the two Vall� named Silkwood and Rosewood. But these last few moons it had only been Black Dugal and Hans Rake for companionship, that and those few fond memories of her father she held dear, and the paling remembrances of her mother. Despite her bitterness, she wanted to cling to those things still. But her previous life with her father seemed lost in a receding haze, memories fading like a moldering echo. Gault had been the steady rock on which her childhood had been forged. That was why she both hated him and loved him now. And that was at the heart of the confusion Dugal had been trying to rid her of from the beginning. He&#x2019;s always been able to sense the conflict within me.<br> <br>One scene was engraved on her memory, the one memory most fond, the one memory she knew that Dugal could not bleed from her yet&#x2014;her last look at her father as he&#x2019;d ridden off to war in Aeros Raijael&#x2019;s army after his last visit to her five years ago. Dressed in splendorous bright armor and gleaming sword, Gault had sat high and tall atop the warhorse that bore him away from her. His last gesture had been a low, graceful bow from his saddle as he&#x2019;d handed her a garland of blue Nordland roses tied about with a dark blue ribbon&#x2014;a ribbon she wore around her left ankle to this day. Always hidden.<br> <br>Caring. Death. Longing for the past. Murder. All incompatible objectives. And Dugal reads me like an open book. A creeping malady gathered in her swirling thoughts. Dugal was correct. Emotions would make her weak. It was why she buried them in that bottomless part of her mind. She wanted that maleficent part of her mind that Dugal had been fostering in her to triumph in the end.

Her bravery is still commemorated each year in the Jewish festival of Purim. / Now this well-known story of the Jewish girl who became the queen of Persia and saved her people from death is retold for young readers. / Bold, colorful Persian-inspired illustrations bring new vibrancy to this old story, which will captivate and inspire its young audience.</p><p>Jenny Koralek has written many children's books, includingNight Ride to Nanna's (Candlewick), Mable'sStory (Olympic Marketing) and Message in aBottle (Lutterworth). A bookworm and music lover, Jennylives in north London.<br><br>Grizelda Holderness has designed book covers for manypublishers, and her illustrations have appeared innumerous magazines. She has also illustrated thechildren's book When the World Began: Stories Collectedin Ethiopia by Elizabeth Laird. She lives in England.<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> "The classic biblical story . . . is told with lucid intrigue, painting a picture of an evil rogue outwitted by the wisdom and courage of a loving Queen. Multiple scenes across full-page spreads, done in deep pastel colors of blues, purples and reds, portray an assortment of tall, handsome characters with lean, pointy-chinned faces, long, flowing hair and dark skin. A well-composed and aesthetic interpretation for the younger set.""&nbsp;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> "Koralek's telling is admirably brisk and dramatic, and she keeps sight of the core message: that Esther's faith and sense of responsibility give her the courage to do the right thing. Holderness's saturated, jewel-tone pastels, geometric lines and subtle patterning successfully meld once-upon-a-time with an exotic Far East. She also gives Esther star-studded raven tresses that reach all the way down to her calves&#x2014;which, as any female member of the target audience will attest, is totally awesome."&nbsp;<b><i>School Library Journal</i></b><br> "The illustrations are the highlight of the book. Stylized, dreamy pastel spreads sing with deep color. Esther, whose name means 'star,' is portrayed with a moon and stars floating in her long dark hair, emphasizing her otherworldly beauty."&nbsp;<b><i>Booklist</i></b><br> ". . . the nicely told story mostly follows the original and is made more child friendly by Holderness' chalky pastel illustrations. Incorporating celestial symbols, including stars and moons, as well as religious images such as Stars of David, the artwork also captures the Persian sensibility of the original tale. Unlike other picture-book versions of Esther's life, Koralek focuses on the queen herself rather than tying her story to the holiday, which adds appeal."</p><h2>I&#39;m Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen</h2><p>Leonard Cohen, one of the most important and influential artists of our era, is a man of powerful emotion and intelligence whose work has explored the essential issues of human life--sex, religion, power, love. Cohen is also a man of complexities and seeming contradictions: a devout Jew, who is also a sophisticate and a ladies&#39; man, as well as an ordained Buddhist monk whose name, Jikan--&#34;ordinary silence&#34;--is quite the appellation for a writer and singer whose life has been anything but ordinary.I&#39;m Your Man is the definitive account of that extraordinary life. Starting in Montreal, Cohen&#39;s birthplace, acclaimed music journalist Sylvie Simmons follows his trail, via London and the Greek island of Hydra, to New York in the sixties, where Cohen launched his career in music. From there she traces the arc of his prodigious achievements to his remarkable retreat in the mid-nineties and his reemergence for a sold-out world tour almost fifteen years later. Whether navigating Cohen&#39;s journeys through the backstreets of Mumbai or his countless hotel rooms along the way, Simmons explores with equal focus every complex, contradictory strand of Cohen&#39;s life and presents a deeply insightful portrait of the vision, spirit, depth, and talent of an artist and a man who continues to move people like no one else.</p><p>"A thoughtful celebration of the artist's life...Simmons has deftly narrated Cohen's evolution... In the end, this biography has the oddest effect: as soon as you finish reading it you feel an overwhelming impulse to go back and begin again, revisiting the story with what you've learned along the way."--A.M. Homes, New York Times Book Review<br><br>"A new gold standard of Cohen bios."--Los Angeles Times<br><br>"This is the bio Cohen has long deserved, and it makes every prior Cohen book practically unnecessary."--Rolling Stone, 4 1/2 Stars<br><br>"The book is a seductive tribute to a master seducer."--The Onion A.V. Club<br><br>"A deep, enlightening book. . . Simmons, a music journalist and short-story writer, knows how to research and write and keep a critical distance from Cohen, who opens up some but uses his usual weapons, politeness and self-deprecation, to maintain an air of mystery."--The Oregonian (Portland)<br><br>"Leonard fought darkness through his work and... the light ultimately prevailed when he triumphantly toured the world for three years beginning in 2008... 'You could hear the hairs stand up on people's arms, ' writes Simmons of the hushed reverence of his audience. This book demands a similar reaction."--MOJO Magazine, 5 Stars<br><br>"This is a revelatory biography that investigates not just an artist's life, but the life of his art."--Shelf Awareness<br><br>"Simmons' rich, compelling and provocative book... is a star-studded but also frank account of how the music industry really works and, at the same time, a discerning portrait of one especially important musician."--Jewish Journal Los Angeles<br><br>"Simmons is a wonderful writer... the book informs like carefully researched non-fiction, but engages like enchanting fiction... Like listening to one of Cohen's songs, this complex, beautiful biography requires you to think about it. This book will stay with you. It will change the way you hear Leonard Cohen."--Paste Magazine<br><br>"In this elegantly crafted biography, Simmons captures the artist who, in spite of all his highs and lows, is still sharp at the edges, a wise old monk, a trouper offering up himself and his songs."--BookPagePublished to coincide with Leonard Cohen's exclusive show at London&#x2019;s The O2 on Friday 21 June 2013. This book contains exclusive material and interviews making it THE biography to buy on Leonard Cohen - singer-songwriter, musician, poet, and novelist.</p><h2>In The Woods</h2><p><p>When he was twelve years old, Adam Ryan went playing in the woods with his two best friends.

There she can learn about the intriguing, dwindling Shaker culture and its medicinal herbs. Unfortunately, the village is plagued with misfortune and strife. China wonders if, with the help of some age-old journals full of scandal, she can get to the bottom of it. But after a shocking death occurs during her stay, China will plunge into the archives of another time to connect the sins of the past with a modern-day murder.</p><p><b>Susan Wittig Albert</b> grew up on a farm in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley.

Recent painful events help prompt China, who runs an herb shop and tearoom in Pecan Springs, Tex., to visit her herbalist friend Martha Edmond at Kentucky's Mount Zion Shaker Village, whose board president, Rachel Hart, wants to turn the quaint Shaker museum center into an upscale spa, contrary to the spirit of the original believers. Martha asks China to investigate recent disturbing events, including vandalism, the suicide of a thieving gift shop manager and, according to financial director Allie Chatham, Rachel's embezzlement of funds. When Allie's later found dead in Zion's pool, where a Shaker woman drowned in 1912, Martha and China suspect murder. Shaker-inspired recipes, excerpts from a fictional Shaker journal, insights into the Shaker religion and plenty of herbal lore enhance another winner from this dependable veteran. <i>Author tour.

A self-taught artist from rural Georgia, she began creating when she was alone after the death of her second husband in 1948. From then until her death, her dreams and memories salved her loneliness with images of a bygone day, and these she made into art. </p><p><i>The Art of Nellie Mae Rowe</i> is the most substantial gathering of her work to date. Here eighty full color and ten black and white images display the artist's extraordinary intuitive color sense and the vibrancy and variety of her work. </p><p>She used whatever materials were at hand. When painting and drawing on paper, Styrofoam, cardboard, and wood, she favored plain and colored pencils, ink and felt tip pens, and gouache. Jewelry, lace, wigs, felt hats, and eye-glasses enhanced her cloth dolls. Sculpting, she gathered found objects, marbles, and glitter and fastened them with chewing gum.

Its cultural, economic, and political dominance is utterly astonishing and unique in world history. Viewing the Italy&#x2015;the many Italies&#x2015;of that time through the lens of today allows us to gather a fragmented, multi-faceted and seemingly contradictory history into a single unifying narrative that speaks to our current reality as much as it does to a specific historical period. This is what the acclaimed French historian, Fernand Braudel, achieves here.

Wright and Borthwick had each abandoned their families to be together, causing a scandal that reverberated far beyond Wright's beloved Wisconsin valley.

The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles.

In 1824 she was sent away to school with her four sisters and they were treated so badly that their father brought them home to Haworth in Yorkshire. The elder two sisters died within a few days and Charlotte and her sisters Emily and Anne were brought up in the isolated village. They were often lonely and loved to walk on the moors. They were all great readers and soon began to write small pieces of verse and stories.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once Charlotte&#x2019;s informal education was over she began to work as a governess and teacher in Yorkshire and Belgium so that she could add to the low family income and help to pay for her brother Branwell&#x2019;s art education. Charlotte was a rather nervous young woman and didn&#x2019;t like to be away from home for too long. The sisters began to write more seriously and published poetry in 1846 under male pen names &#x2013; there was a lot of prejudice against women writers. The book was not a success and the sisters all moved on to write novels. Charlotte&#x2019;s best-known book, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, appeared in 1847 and was soon seen as a work of genius. Charlotte really knew how to make characters and situations come alive.</p><p>Charlotte&#x2019;s life was full of tragedy, never more so than when her brother Branwell and sisters Emily and Anne died within a few months in 1848/49.

In clashing with descendants of the prehistoric Indian population, the Spanish began three centuries of struggles that lasted through the nineteenth century when the steamroller of United States expansion arrived.

Shouts from the catwalk caught Theodore&#x2019;s attention. He looked up, barely able to see the guard at the far south of the walk. The man was limping, but functional. Where were the others? Had they fallen to the other side? Twenty feet probably wouldn&#x2019;t kill them, but they&#x2019;d likely be immobile.<br><br>Theodore carefully started up the slope that had been the wall. Razor wire, embedded in the destroyed wall, was now everywhere. While his sturdy shoes protected his feet, he couldn&#x2019;t use his hands for fear of slicing them. If he made it over the debris, he didn&#x2019;t want open cuts because there was only one way out:<br><br>The San Francisco Bay.<br><br>He sensed other inmates following him, and two were ahead. He saw the crooked arm of a guard, his green uniform covered in dust. Trapped by the concrete when it fell. Dead? Very likely. Theodore scanned the area for a rifle as he continued moving forward, up the concrete mountain. The weapon must be buried with the dead guard.<br><br>A voice from the far side of the catwalk ordered Theodore to stop. He didn&#x2019;t hesitate, but continued climbing the collapsed wall. He spied another guard near the top of the rubble, this one not dead but injured, blood pouring from a head wound. He kept shaking his head as if to clear it, but held fast to his rifle, which swung erratically to and fro. It didn&#x2019;t look like the guard could see much of anything, blood covering one eye. His expression was panicked. Fearful.<br><br>Theodore realized then that the guard who had ordered him to stop was trapped on the far side of the catwalk, which had partially collapsed, pulled down by the weight of the falling wall. Where were the other guards? The air was thick with dust and fog, Theodore wasn&#x2019;t sure what he was seeing.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; the guard called again, but he was aiming his gun behind Theodore. How many were following him? Why wasn&#x2019;t the guard shooting? Afraid to hit a fallen officer?<br><br>Over the loudspeaker, a voice commanded, &#x201c;Down! Lay facedown, hands behind your head or you will be shot.&#x201d;<br><br>Theodore ignored the warning. A guard was pursuing him, but the yard guards had nonfatal rubber bullets. Behind him were shouts and screams.<br><br>Reaching the wounded guard, without hesitation Theodore ripped the rifle from his shaking hands. The bastard should have shot first, he thought with a tight grin. With the stock of the rifle, Theodore hit the fallen guard twice&#x2014;wham! wham!&#x2014;on the head.<br><br>He collapsed, unconscious and more likely dead. Gun in hand, Theodore rolled down the far side of the wall.<br><br>&#x201c;You bastard! You didn&#x2019;t need to kill him!&#x201d;<br><br>Theodore turned to fire the rifle, thinking it was a pursuing guard. Instead, he saw convict Thomas O&#x2019;Brien, another condemned man recently transferred from North Seg, the country club of death row. O&#x2019;Brien rolled down behind him, cutting his hand on razor wire.<br><br>Theodore aimed the rifle at the traitorous prisoner. He&#x2019;d had a suspicion about O&#x2019;Brien ever since he walked into East Block last week.<br><br>A bullet whizzed past Theodore. He wished he&#x2019;d had time to retrieve the guard&#x2019;s sidearm, but it was buried along with the dead guard&#x2019;s legs. Instead of killing his fellow prisoner, Theodore turned and returned fire. Enough to give him cover.<br><br>The earth rolled beneath him. Aftershock.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t fall, but O&#x2019;Brien did. The guard pursuing them also stumbled.<br><br>Gunfire echoed around him and he zigzagged through the short open space. He spared a glance toward where the main guard tower should be.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t there.<br><br>Sirens, shouts, gunfire sounded all around. Theodore ran. The two convicts in front of him jumped into the bay. He followed.<br><br>He swam northeast, away from San Francisco and the violence of the bay; toward the Richmond&#x2013;San Rafael Bridge. If he could reach the bridge, he&#x2019;d have a better chance of escaping.<br><br>The cold water burned his hands. He realized he had cuts all over them, small nicks that the saltwater turned to searing pain.<br><br>He slung the gun over his shoulder. It would be worthless in the water, but he could dry it out, use it again, if he was lucky.<br><br>He swam. Heard splashes behind him, others following suit. His active, rigorous lifestyle before prison had given him physical strength, which he&#x2019;d maintained over the last seven years. If anyone could survive the San Francisco Bay, it was him. He was certain of it.<br><br>The more convicts on the run, the greater chance he had to escape. They would be slower than him. Already he had passed the two convicts who&#x2019;d jumped ahead of him.<br><br>The water froze and burned, it was early February, light was fading, all he needed was the cover of dark and stamina, and he would be free. He&#x2019;d been waiting for this opportunity, the first chance to be free. To think he&#x2019;d wasted the last seven years on appeals when all he&#x2019;d had to do was relax and wait for an act of God!<br><br>He almost laughed. Instead, he gritted his teeth against the pain and cold of the San Francisco Bay, found his rhythm, and swam hard through the choppy water.<br><br>Adrenaline surged through his blood, triggering every cell in his body. He&#x2019;d never felt so alive.</p><h2>The Sword of the Templars (&#34;JOHN &#34;&#34;DOC&#34;&#34; HOLLIDAY&#34;)</h2><p><b>From the <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of <i>The Aztec Heresy</i><br><br> A mystery that spans the past<br><br> A conspiracy that lives on in the heart of an ancient order...</b><br><br> Army Ranger Lt.

When his uncle passes away, Holliday discovers a medieval sword-wrapped in Adolf Hitler's personal battle standard.

Discovering a hidden message within the sword, Doc and Peggy set out to solve its riddle in an adventure filled with danger around every corner. Narrator Paul Boehmer delivers a somewhat flat performance that fails to convey excitement when the story calls for it--though he differentiates characters well and consistently. But the story itself is somewhat predictable and, when coupled with Boehmer&#39;s flat narration, makes for a mediocre listening experience.

So does the dweomer. Some men choose to stand in the light; others, in the darkness. Be ye always aware that where you stand is a matter of choice, and let not the shadow creep over you unawares....<br> &#x2014;The Secret Book of Cadwallon the Druid<br> &nbsp;<br> Back in the eleventh century, when the far-flung kingdom of Deverry lay sparse and tentative across the lands men claimed in the king&#x2019;s name, Eldidd province was one of the most sparsely settled areas of all. Particularly in its western reaches, towns were rare, and in the west Dun Gwerbyn was something of a governmental seat, even though its high stone walls circled barely five hundred thatched houses and three temples, two of those little better than wayside shrines. On a hill in the center of town, however, stood the dun, or fort, of the tieryn, large and solid enough to be impressive in any province at that time. Inside a double set of earthworks and ditches, stone walls sheltered stables and barracks for the tieryn&#x2019;s warband of a hundred men, a collection of huts and storage sheds, and the broch complex itself, a four-story round stone tower with two shorter towers built on to the sides.<br> &nbsp;<br> On one particular morning, the open ward round the broch was abustle with servants, carrying supplies to the kitchen hut or stacks of firewood to the hearths in the great hall, or rolling big barrels of ale from the sheds to the broch. Near the iron-bound gates other servants bowed low as they greeted the arriving wedding guests. Cullyn of Cerrmor, captain of the tieryn&#x2019;s warband, assembled his sen out in the ward and looked them over. For a change they were all bathed, shaved, and presentable. He himself, a burly man well over six feet tall, had put on the newer of his two shirts for the occasion ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well and good, lads,&#x201d; Cullyn said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look bad for a pack of hounds. Now, remember: every lord and lady in the tierynrhyn is going to be here today. I don&#x2019;t want any of you getting stinking drunk, and I don&#x2019;t want any fighting, either. This is a wedding, remember, and the lady deserves to have it be a happy one after everything she&#x2019;s been through.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They all nodded solemnly. If any of them forgot his orders, he&#x2019;d make them regret it&#x2014;and they knew it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cullyn led them into the great hall, an enormous round room that took up the full ground floor of the broch. Today freshly braided rushes lay on the floor; the tapestries on the walls had been shaken out and rehung. The hall was crammed with extra tables. Not only were there plenty of noble guests, but each lord had brought five men from his warband as an honor escort. Servants sidled and edged their way through the crowd with tankards of ale and baskets of bread; a bard played almost unheard; over by their hearth the riders diced for coppers and joked; up by the honor hearth the noble-born ladies chattered like birds while their husbands drank. Cullyn got his men settled, repeated his order about no fighting, then worked his way to the table of honor and knelt at the tieryn&#x2019;s side.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tieryn Lovyan was something of an anomaly in Deverry, a woman who ruled a large demesne in her own name. Originally her only brother had held this dun, but when he died without an heir, she&#x2019;d inherited under a twist in the laws designed to keep big holdings in a clan even if a woman had to rule them. Although she&#x2019;d come to her middle age, she was still a good-looking woman, with gray-streaked raven black hair, large cornflower-blue eyes, and the straight-backed posture of one quite at home with rulership. That particular day she wore a dress of red Bardek silk, kirtled in with the red, white, and brown plaid of the Clw Coc clan.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The warband is in attendance, my lady,&#x201d; Cullyn said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Splendid, Captain. Have you seen Nevyn yet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t, my lady.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It would be like him to just stay away. He does so hate crowds and such like, but if you do see him, tell him to come sit with me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cullyn rose, bowed, and returned to his men. From his seat he could see the honor table, and while he sipped his ale, he studied the bride at this wedding, Lady Donilla, a beautiful woman with a mane of chestnut hair, clasped back like a maiden&#x2019;s now for the formality of the thing. Cullyn felt profoundly sorry for her, because her first husband, Gwerbret Rhys of Aberwyn, had recently cast her off for being barren. If Lovyan hadn&#x2019;t found her a husband, she would have had to return to her brother&#x2019;s dun in shame. As it was, her new man, Lord Garedd, was a decent-looking fellow some years older than she, with gray in his blond hair and a thick mustache. From what the men in the warband said, he was an honorable man, soft-spoken in peace and utterly ruthless in war. He was also a widower with a pack of children and thus more than glad to take a beautiful young wife, barren or not.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Garedd looks honestly besotted with her, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; Nevyn remarked.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a yelp Cullyn turned to find the old man grinning at him. For all of Nevyn&#x2019;s white hair, and a face as lined as an old leather sack, he had all the vigor and stamina of a young lad, and he stood there straight-backed, his hands on his hips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean to startle you,&#x201d; he said with a sly grin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here, I never saw you come in!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t looking my way, that&#x2019;s all. I didn&#x2019;t turn myself invisible, although I&#x2019;ll admit to having a bit of a jest on you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And I took the bait, sure enough. The tieryn wants you to come sit with her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At the honor table? What a blasted nuisance. It&#x2019;s a good thing I put on a clean shirt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cullyn laughed. Usually Nevyn dressed like a farmer in shabby brown clothes, but today he&#x2019;d actually put on a white shirt with Lovyan&#x2019;s red lion blazon at the yokes and a pair of patched but respectable gray brigga. Still, he looked like a shabby townsman or maybe a minor servitor, anything but what he was, the most powerful master of the dweomer in the entire kingdom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Before you go,&#x201d; Cullyn said, &#x201c;have you had any, well, news of my Jill?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;News? Why don&#x2019;t you say the word &#x2018;scrying&#x2019; right out? You&#x2019;ll have to get used to sorcery sooner or later, Captain. Here, come along.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They made their way over to the servants&#x2019; hearth, where an entire hog crackled, roasting on a spit so large that it took two kitchen boys to turn it. For a moment Nevyn stared intently into the flames.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see Jill and her Rhodry looking in good spirits,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re walking through a town on a nice sunny day, going up to a shop of some sort. Wait! I know the place. It&#x2019;s Otho the Silversmith&#x2019;s in Dun Mannannan, but he doesn&#x2019;t seem to be in at the moment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you can tell if she&#x2019;s with child.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not showing the baby if she is. I can understand your concern.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s bound to happen, sooner or later. I just hope she has the wit to ride home when it does.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s never lacked for wit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Cullyn agreed, worry ate at him. Jill was, after all, his only child.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I just hope they have enough coin for the winter,&#x201d; the captain remarked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, we gave them plenty between us, if Rhodry doesn&#x2019;t drink it all away, anyway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, Jill won&#x2019;t let him do that. My lass is as tight as an old farmwife with every cursed copper.&#x201d; He allowed himself a brief smile. &#x201c;She knows the long road well.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Because the mattress was full of bedbugs, Rhodry Maelwaedd, formerly heir to Dun Gwerbyn, sat on the floor of the tiny innchamber. Nearby Jill sat in the light from the one tiny window. She was dressed in a pair of dirty blue brigga and a lad&#x2019;s plain linen overshirt, and her golden hair was cropped short like a lad&#x2019;s, too, but she was so beautiful, with her wide blue eyes, delicate features, and soft mouth, that he loved simply looking at her. Frowning in concentration, she was mending a rip in his only shirt.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, by the black hairy ass of the Lord of Hell!&#x201d; she snarled. &#x201c;This&#x2019;ll just have to do. I hate sewing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You have my humble thanks for lowering yourself enough to mend my clothes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With another snarl she threw the shirt into his face. Laughing, he shook it out, once-white linen stained with sweat and rust, as well, from his mail. On the yokes were embroidered the blazons of the red lion, all that he had left of his old life. But a month earlier his brother, Gwerbret Rhys of Aberwyn, had sent him into exile, far away from kin and clan both. He pulled the shirt on, then buckled his sword belt over it. At the left hung his sword, a beautiful blade of the best steel with the hand guard worked in the form of a dragon, and at the right, the silver dagger that branded him as a dishonored man. It was the badge of a band of mercenaries who wandered the roads either singly or in pairs and fought only for coin, not loyalty or honor. In his case it branded him as something even stranger, which was why they&#x2019;d come to Dun Mannannan.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you think that silversmith will be in by now?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No doubt. Otho wouldn&#x2019;t leave his shop for long.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Together they went out into the unwalled town, a straggling collection of round thatched houses and shops along a river. On the grassy bank fishing boats lay bleaching, from the look of their cracked keels and gaping planks barely seaworthy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how these people make a living from the sea,&#x201d; Rhodry remarked. &#x201c;Look at that mast. It&#x2019;s all held together with wound rope and tar.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When he started to walk over for a better look, Jill grabbed his arm and hauled him back. Two local men, hard-eyed and dressed in filthy rags, were watching.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Rhetorics of Fantasy</h2><p>Transcending arguments over the definition of fantasy literature, Rhetorics of Fantasy introduces a provocative new system of classification for the genre. Utilizing nearly two hundred examples of modern fantasy, author Farah Mendlesohn uses this system to explore how fiction writers construct their fantastic worlds. Mendlesohn posits four categories of fantasy&#x2015;portal-quest, immersive, intrusion, and liminal&#x2015;that arise out of the relationship of the protagonist to the fantasy world. Using these sets, Mendlesohn argues that the author's stylistic decisions are then shaped by the inescapably political demands of the category in which they choose to write. Each chapter covers at least twenty books in detail, ranging from nineteenth-century fantasy and horror to extensive coverage of some of the best books in the contemporary field. Offering a wide-ranging discussion and penetrating comparative analysis, Rhetorics of Fantasy will excite fans and provide a wealth of material for scholarly and classroom discussion.<br><br>Includes discussion of works by over 100 authors, including Lloyd Alexander, Peter Beagle, Marion Zimmer Bradley, John Crowley, Stephen R.

Addressing such "artists of refusal" as Robert Walser, Robert Musil, Arthur Rimbaud, Marcel Duchamp, Herman Melville, and J. D. Salinger, <em>Bartleby &amp; Co.</em> could be described as a meditation: a walking tour through the annals of literature. Written as a series of footnotes (a non-work itself), <em>Bartleby</em> embarks on such questions as why do we write, why do we exist? The answer lies in the novel itself: told from the point of view of a hermetic hunchback who has no luck with women, and is himself unable to write, <em>Bartleby</em> is utterly engaging, a work of profound and philosophical beauty.</p><p><p><strong>ENRIQUE VILA-MATAS</strong> was born in Barcelona.

The late-night passing of a beloved aunt summons a childhood bully who shows up minutes later, after twenty-five years, to be forgiven and to heal a broken doctor. This ER doctor finds God&#39;s opposite in: a battered child&#39;s bruises covered over by make-up, a dying patient whose son finally shows up at the end to reclaim the man&#39;s high-top sneakers, the rich or celebrity patients loaded with prescription drugs from doctor friends who end up addicted.

Allen set out to understand why this was so and, more importantly, to remedy the situation. The result is this powerful collection of traditional tales, biographical writings, and contemporary short stories, many by the most accomplished Native American women writing today, including: Louise Erdrich, Mary TallMountain, Linda Hogan, and many others.</p><p><b>Paula Gunn Allen</b>&nbsp;(1939&#x2013;2008) was a professor of Native American studies/ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley. She was the author of <i>Skins and Bones</i>, <i>WYRDS, The Sacred Hoop: Recovering the Feminine in American Indian Traditions</i>, and <i>The Woman Who Owned the Shadows</i>.These 24 compelling and bleakly evocative narratives compiled by Allen, a professor of Native American studies at the University of California, all stress the theme of loss: loss of identity, loss of culture, loss of personal meaning. By juxtaposing traditional stories with contemporary tales, Allen allows readers to see how the same themes, values and perceptions have endured through the centuries, "testaments to cultural persistence, to a vision and a spiritual reality that will not die." Echoes of the traditional "Oshkikwe's Baby," about an old witch who steals babies, can be found in two stories. In Louise Erdrich's "American Horse," a white social worker separates a boy from his mother for his own "good," to the anguish of mother and son. In "As It Was in the Beginning," by E. Pauline Johnson, a preacher takes a girl away from her family to attend a mission school; the tale is a powerful indictment of the hypocrisy of the "Christian" white culture in dealing with native Americans. The importance of storytelling in keeping the Pawnee culture alive is beautifully conveyed in Anna Lee Walter's "The Warriors," in which their alcoholic uncle teaches two sisters that they must struggle to find beauty in the midst of squalor and poverty--"For beauty is why we live," he says. Allen's somewhat patronizing attitude toward her non-Native audience--in her introduction and editorial notes--is sometimes intrusive, but should not detract from the poignant impact of these stories. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The System of Dante&#39;s Hell (AkashiClassics: Renegade Reprint Series)</h2><p>"Much of the novel is an expression of the intellectual and moral lost motion of the age...the special agony of the American Negro."<br>--<b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"A fevered and impressionistic riff on the struggles of blacks in the urban North and rural South, as told through the prism of <i>The Inferno</i>....Other writers addressed race more directly, but for all its linguistic slipperiness, Baraka's language conveys the feelings of fear, violation, and fury with a surprising potency.

But I&#x2019;ve more than twenty summers now, Mother is far away in the north building </i>D�n na S�och�na<i>,</i> <i>I&#x2019;m his heir. I must do this for him.</i></p><p>His big long-fingered hands were crossed on the hilt of the Sword of the Lady as he lay on the bier, shapely though scarred and battered. He was dressed plainly in the simple kilt and shirt and plaid, ankle-boots and knee-hose of the people who&#x2019;d borne him. There was an inhuman peace now to the face that had been so lively with the play of thought and feeling, and the golden torque around his neck hid the wound that had killed him. Rudi Mackenzie&#x2014;High King Artos&#x2014;had been a tall man, still broad-shouldered and narrow-hipped in his forty-seventh year; his red-gold hair held no trace of gray, or his short-cropped beard, though there were deep lines beside his eyes. It was as if he were withdrawing before her eyes, from the living man who had sired her to the sculptured image of the King who&#x2019;d forged a realm that stretched over half a continent.</p><p><i>From the light of common day into the time of legends.</i></p><p>At least she was among Mackenzie clansfolk, mostly, so they wouldn&#x2019;t expect her not to weep. Following the steps of ritual helped, she found. The tears trickled down her face, but her voice was steady as she laid the torch at her feet and raised her arms in her faith&#x2019;s gesture of prayer:</p><p>&#x201c;He was High King and father to all the land, but to me he was my da,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This memory I give, and it is my first of him: my mother lets me go and I run stumping towards him and he sweeps me up, high, so high, and he laughing up at me with the wind and sun in his hair, his hands as strong as the bones of Earth and gentle as the Lady&#x2019;s love. We will miss you, I and Mother and the sibs. Wait for us in the Summerlands beyond the Western Gate, Da, where no sorrow or evil comes and all hurts are healed.&#x201d;</p><p>She <i>knew</i> that would be so; as he lay dying they had grasped the Sword of the Lady together, and they had met and spoken in the world beyond the world. The eeriness of it was still with her a day later, but it was colder comfort than she would have thought. He&#x2019;d said grief was for the living, and it was so. He still was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he was <i>gone</i>.</p><p>The symbol of the High Kingdom lay naked on his breast now, by his own longstanding command for the day of his death-pyre. In its form it was a knight&#x2019;s weapon, what they called a hand-and-a-half sword; thirty-six straight inches of tapering double-edged blade, a shallow crescent of guard, a long double-lobed hilt of silver-inlaid black staghorn ending in a pommel of moonstone gripped in antlers. Merely a sword of superlative quality, until you looked closely. Then there were patterns in the metal and crystal&#x2014;not quite seen&#x2014;that led the mind inward and inward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>She&#x2019;d heard her father say that the blade he had brought back from the Quest might not be a thing of matter at all as humankind understood the word. Instead somehow an embodied <i>concept</i>, a thought in the mind of the Goddess, one that could be touched in the light of common day. Though that was a perilous thing, very dangerous indeed to anyone not of the Royal kin.</p><p>The pyre was a large one, set in a deep pit so that the top was breast-high to the ground about, with a narrow trench to provide draught. Mackenzies gave their dead to the fire and the ashes to Earth for the most part, and the High King had long made clear that he wished that rite. Dun Barstow was a new settlement that had spent hard labor clearing land here in the renascent wilderness that had once been California, and it was the eve of Beltane, a festival always celebrated with bonfires; there was any amount of dry timber on hand, even with the other funeral pyres that had been needed.</p><p>Edain Aylward Mackenzie came up next, to stand at the northern end of the pyre. He was commander of the High King&#x2019;s Archers, a stocky broad-shouldered man of about her father&#x2019;s age with a square weathered face, oak-brown curls and gray eyes. His voice held the Mackenzie lilt, stronger than hers:</p><p>&#x201c;He was my Chief, and my friend from my earliest years, the brother of my heart, the one I chose, the one I followed on the Quest to Nantucket. My father Samkin Aylward taught us both the bow. This memory I give: when I first carried the Silver Arrow at the Lughnasadh Games, my da gave me a nod and a hand on the shoulder I prized more than the Arrow itself. Then Da turned and cuffed <i>him</i> upside the head and said he was a natural, he&#x2019;d been slacking on his practice or he&#x2019;d have done better than third place. He grinned, that smile that could bring the birds from the trees, and said: <i>Edain has the blessing of Llew of the Steady Hand as much as I, Sam, and he works harder at it; he earned it, it&#x2019;s his.</i> Ochone, my Chief, would that I could have died for you! But I&#x2019;ll look to the lass and Prince John and Vuissance and Faol�n so long as a man may, I promise you that. We&#x2019;ll have a mug together and talk it over, in the Land of Summer.&#x201d;</p><p>The headman of Dun Barstow was Oak Barstow Mackenzie, a tall rangy graying man, one of the few here who&#x2019;d been born before the Change&#x2014;though he&#x2019;d been a child of nine and couldn&#x2019;t remember it beyond fragments. He&#x2019;d been First Armsman of the Clan Mackenzie for many years. When he laid it down he&#x2019;d led a party of pioneers south to found Dun Barstow, including many of his own children and grandchildren.</p><p>He stepped forward and nodded somberly.</p><p>&#x201c;I was an orphan of the Change, reared in Dun Juniper, and I knew Rudi Mackenzie first as a brat running about underfoot, then a wild youngster always in a scrape. When he returned from the Quest with the Sword of the Lady and was hailed the <i>Ard R�</i>, the High King, it was as a story from the old tales to me, and I cheered it mainly because I saw how it gave our folk heart in those dark times and united the alliance. This memory I give: when I led the full levy north from our d�thchas in the Prophet&#x2019;s War, I told him: <i>This is all we have, Ard R�. If we lose it, the Clan dies.</i> And he nodded, and told me what he&#x2019;d planned. As he spoke the memory of him tumbling with the puppies before the hearth dropped away, and my heart said within me:</p><p><i>&#x201c;This man is a King you may follow to the death. You may leave your bones on foreign soil, but he will save our folk.</i></p><p>&#x201c;The great battles lay ahead, and the march to Corwin, but I never doubted again.&#x201d;</p><p>Heuradys d&#x2019;Ath came to the eastern side. Alone of them she wasn&#x2019;t a Mackenzie, though she was of the Old Faith: she was a noble of the Portland Protective Association from the north-realm, �rlaith&#x2019;s liege-sworn knight and her best friend. And of her own generation, only two years older, like her one of those who&#x2019;d grown up wholly in the world the Change had made, children of those who had laid its foundations.</p><p>&#x201c;This memory I share,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When I came to be a page at Court, only �rlaith was my friend at first, and the High King seemed godlike to me, to be honored from far away. The other Associate pages were all boys and all Catholics, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then the High King came to the <i>salle d&#x2019;armes</i>, and I&#x2019;d just lost a practice bout. I was sitting there rubbing my elbow&#x2014;and telling myself I would <i>not</i> cry where anyone could see me&#x2014;and he just stood at the back, arms crossed, making this little gesture to the teacher to keep going, and watching. I got back up and picked up my practice blade and stepped into another circle and lost <i>again</i>. He watched me keep losing and keep going back time after time. I was the youngest there, and the smallest, and the others didn&#x2019;t dare bully me too badly in the open but they thought they could make me so miserable I&#x2019;d leave anyway.</p><p>&#x201c;I got back up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he walked over and said to me: <i>And so you wish to be a knight, do you? My knight?</i> And I said: <i>No, Your Majesty. I&#x2019;ll be Princess Orrey&#x2019;s knight and fight by her side and be the shield on her shoulder!</i></p><p>&#x201c;And he smiled, and rested his hand on the Sword and looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. looked <i>through</i> the wall for a moment. And then he looked back at me and said, so that everyone could hear:</p><p><i>&#x201c;And so you will be, girl, and glad of it I am, for I want only the best backing my Princess in the hour of her deadly need.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Heuradys lifted her gaze and smiled, though her eyes were wet. &#x201c;And after that, First Armsman Oak, I also never doubted that I would win the victory, hard as it might be.&#x201d;</p><p>She turned to the bier and lifted her hands. &#x201c;Go in peace to the Shades, my King, and rest content in the flower-meads of <i>El�sion ped�on</i> before you drink of Lethe and return. I will fulfill my oath.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a moment of echoing silence, with the sound of the birds greeting the sunset the loudest noise, that and the wind in the treetops. Then a set of bagpipes began to play, a slow mournful pibroch of lament. The piper paced slowly ahead of the High Priestess of the Dun&#x2019;s coven, Oak&#x2019;s daughter Rowan, a lanky brown-haired woman in her thirties. She wore a black cloak over her white robe and a black scowl on her fair face as she raised a staff topped with the Triple Moon, waxing and full and waning. Behind her two muscular women carried a large wooden yoke, holding a cauldron loaded with coals, and another pair and another pair came behind, each with a cauldron packed with oak burned down to a savage white heat. A dry smell of scorched bronze and silver and iron filled the air, under the sap of the cut wood in the pyre.</p><p>A song began as the piper paced in a circle around the High King&#x2019;s resting place, walking <i>deosil</i>, sunwise, as the spirit traveled to the Western Gate.</p><p><i>&#x201c;We all come from the Goddess</i></p><p><i>And to Her we shall return</i></p><p><i>Like a drop of rain</i></p><p><i>Flowing to the ocean&#x2014;&#x201d;</i></p><p>�rlaith met the angry hazel eyes calmly, more calmly than she felt. They&#x2019;d had words; Rowan had thought the day wrong. This was Beltane Eve&#x2014;which was the festival of love and life, as Samhain was of death and endings and the Otherworld. Few gainsaid a High Priestess of the triple cords in her own dun, and this one had all the bull-headed stubbornness Oak had shown on the battlefields of the Prophet&#x2019;s War, and all the strength of will of her grandmother Judy who&#x2019;d been the Clan&#x2019;s first healer and Maiden of the Singing Moon coven before the Change. The cross-talk had rent the afternoon as the women washed the High King&#x2019;s body while the men had laid out clothing and gear to wear on his final journey. Finally Oak had stepped in, his gnarled hand gentle on his daughter&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>A leanbh na p�irte</i>; hush now. Beltane is the rite of life and love, yes. But the High King has fallen on this eve, leaving us the young Queen to pick up the reins. So does her life as Queen begin; and his death is the sacrifice that renews the life of the land, his blood freely spilled upon it bringing the growth of spring, as the Lord of the Corn dies and is reborn. From death comes life. She is the Spring Queen indeed, her strength and youth that of the kingdom. So it is fitting that he should be sent on his way on the holy day, and by her hand.&#x201d;</p><p>They&#x2019;d been silenced, and Rowan had bowed her head and agreed to the pyre this very night. But ill feeling lingered. And �rlaith was too shaken to be diplomatic.</p><p>Rowan came to Edain&#x2019;s side, the priestesses with the black cauldron following her. The white and the brass cauldrons were brought equidistant along the pyre, closer to �rlaith. Rowan looked across to the Princess and her face changed as she thrust back the cowl and shook free her hair. Each Priestess copied her, and after a second, �rlaith, Heraudys, Edain and Oak did likewise. Rowan cut a long lock of her hair and held it in her left hand. The small crowd beyond milled and seethed. �rlaith glanced back to see them holding up their hands, holding locks cut free. She swallowed, her throat tight again. That was the rite for close kin or <i>anamchara</i>&#x2014;oath-sword brothers or sisters of the soul, for it sent part of your very self to the otherworld with the dead. Her father had been respected by all, feared by enemies of the peace he&#x2019;d brought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he&#x2019;d also been loved by many. Her own grief was a wave on a great sea of sorrow that would wash over the kingdom. That didn&#x2019;t make it less, but it did make her feel a little less alone.</p><p>Rowan opened her mouth and took a breath&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and let it out, again, and shook her head, tears suddenly running down her face; �rlaith heard them clogging her throat as she tried to speak through them. Edain turned and tugged out a handkerchief from his sporran and handed it over. Rowan gave a half-hysterical laugh that hiccuped and skidded sideways.</p><p>&#x201c;I wanted to be so solemn, so perfect for the High King!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The honest voice of your heart is a greater tribute,&#x201d; her father said gently.</p><p>�rlaith felt her own anger fade. There had been times in her childhood when she was jealous of the way her parents seemed to belong to everyone&#x2014;the King was Father to the land, and the Queen stood for the Mother. Right now seeing the echo of her grief brought a sense of fellowship.</p><p>The High Priestess turned to those watching&#x2014;the folk of Dun Barstow, the archers and men-at-arms and varlets of the Royal party, and the others from half-built Castle Rutherford who&#x2019;d answered the courier&#x2019;s call to arrive horror-struck to find the High King dead, killed by a prisoner&#x2019;s treachery after the short victorious fight. The Nihonjin who&#x2019;d been rescued stood at a farther remove, and kneeled as they sat back on their heels, heads bowed in respect. Not that they hadn&#x2019;t borne their share of the fight, and more, and their own Emperor had fallen in it.</p><p>Rowan&#x2019;s voice rose, soaring sure now, as if something or Someone else joined its strength to hers:</p><p>&#x201c;As it was said in the ancient days and now again&#x2014;<i>The King is dead! Long live the Queen!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>The crowd took up the cry, and �rlaith bowed her head a little at the crushing weight of it. In strict law according to the Great Charter she wouldn&#x2019;t be assuming the throne until she was twenty-six, still a few years from now. Her mother the High Queen Mathilda had always been her father&#x2019;s right hand and closest councilor as well as his handfasted wife, and �rlaith knew she would be doing the bulk of the work for years to come, she and Chancellor Ignatius and Edain and High Marshal d&#x2019;Ath and the others.</p><p>Rowan was speaking as the Lady&#x2019;s priestess, at a level beyond human law and politics; or above or behind or beneath it. She went on, her voice...</p></p><h2>Psycho USA: Famous American Killers You Never Heard Of</h2><p>AMERICA&#x2019;S MOST COLD-BLOODED!<br> &nbsp;<br> In the horrifying annals of American crime, the infamous names of brutal killers such as Bundy, Dahmer, Gacy, and Berkowitz are writ large in the imaginations of a public both horrified and hypnotized by their monstrous, murderous acts.

And of these nightmarish figures, perhaps the most infamous was William Beadle, perpetrator of what one contemporary described as &#x201c;a crime more atrocious and horrible&#x201d; than any ever committed in New England &#x201c;and scarcely exceeded in the history of man.&#x201d;<br><br>Born in England in 1730, Beadle emigrated to America at the age of thirty-two and eventually settled in the village of Wethersfield, Connecticut, where he operated a country store stocked with an unusually &#x201c;handsome assortment of goods.&#x201d; Surviving documents show him to have been possessed by the sort of overweening egotism typical of family annihilators. Though acknowledging his unprepossessing looks, he regarded himself as far superior to the run of humanity. &#x201c;My person is small and mean to look on,&#x201d; he wrote in one journal entry, &#x201c;and my circumstances were always rather narrow, which were great disadvantages in the world. But I have great reason to think that my soul is above the common mould.&#x201d; In his self-conceit, he likened himself to &#x201c;a diamond among millions of pebbles.&#x201d;<br><br>For several years his business thrived. Fiercely proud of his success, he maintained a handsome residence and entertained guests in grand style. He was held in high esteem by his neighbors, who saw him as an honorable tradesman, generous host, loving husband, and doting father.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, however, Beadle suffered reversals that left him in dire financial straits. Unable to &#x201c;bear the mortification of being thought poor and dependent,&#x201d; he struggled to keep &#x201c;up the outward appearance of his former affluence.&#x201d; Eventually, however, he succumbed to despair. The thought of being perceived as a failure by his townsmen was more than he could tolerate. &#x201c;If a man, who has once lived well, meant well, and done well, falls by unavoidable accident into poverty and submits to be laughed at, despised, and trampled on by a set of mean wretches as far below him as the moon is below the sun; I say, if such a man submits, he must become meaner than meanness itself.&#x201d;<br><br>Concluding that suicide was less shameful than poverty, he decided to kill himself and his family. Like other killers of his psychopathic breed, he justified his intended atrocity as an act of kindness, even love. &#x201c;I mean to close the eyes of six persons through perfect humanity and the most endearing fondness and friendship; for mortal father never felt more of these tender ties than myself.&#x201d; Initially, he thought he might spare his wife. After much deliberation, however, he concluded that it would be cruel &#x201c;to leave her behind to languish out a life in misery and wretchedness.&#x201d; With her entire family suddenly gone, death would be a mercy for her.<br><br>As he began to mull over his plan, he &#x201c;kept hoping that Providence would turn up something to prevent it, if the intent were wrong.&#x201d; Instead, &#x201c;every circumstance, from the greatest to the smallest trifle,&#x201d; only served to convince him that destroying his family was the only sensible course. For a while, he prayed that his twelve-year-old son and three little daughters might perish accidentally, thus sparing him the necessity of killing them. To facilitate that end, he removed the protective wooden cover from the backyard well. He also encouraged them to swim in the deepest and most treacherous parts of the nearby river. When the children stubbornly survived these perils, he resolved to take more direct action.<br><br>Though uncertain at first as to when and how he would accomplish his &#x201c;great affair&#x201d; (as he described the intended massacre), he had no doubt that he would not quail when the time came. &#x201c;How I shall really perform the task I have undertaken I know not till the moment arrives,&#x201d; he wrote in his journal. &#x201c;But I believe I shall perform it as deliberately and as steadily as I would go to supper, or to bed.&#x201d;<br><br>He eventually fixed on the eighteenth of November for the execution of his plan. He first &#x201c;procured a noble supper of oysters, that my family and I may eat and drink together, thank God, and then die.&#x201d; He was forced to abandon his plan, however, when the maid&#x2014;who had been sent off on an errand&#x2014;returned unexpectedly and &#x201c;prevented him for that time.&#x201d;<br><br>A few weeks later, he made another aborted attempt that he described in his journal:<br><br>On the morning of the sixth of December, I rose before the sun, felt calm, and left my wife between sleep and wake, went into the room where my infants lay, found them all sound asleep; the means of death were with me, but I had not before determined whether to strike or not, but yet thought it a good opportunity. I stood over them, and asked my God whether it was right or not now to strike; but no answer came: nor I believe ever does to man while on earth. I then examined myself, there was neither fear, trembling, nor horror about me. I then went into a chamber next to that to look at myself in the glass; but I could discover no alteration in my countenanced of feelings: this is true as God reigns, but for further trial I yet postponed it.<br><br>Five days later, in the early morning hours of December 11, 1782, Beadle finally carried out his atrocity. Tiptoeing into the second-floor bedchamber shared by his four children and the housemaid, he shook the latter awake, then &#x201c;ordered her to rise gently without disturbing the children&#x201d; and meet him downstairs. When she appeared several minutes later, he handed her a note for the family physician, Dr. Farnsworth, who lived about a quarter-mile away. His wife, Beadle explained, had been &#x201c;ill all night.&#x201d; The housemaid was to proceed to Farnsworth&#x2019;s home at once, give him the note, and remain there until he &#x201c;should come with her.&#x201d;<br><br>No sooner had she left on this errand than Beadle hurried into his bedroom, where he had stashed a newly sharpened ax and carving knife. After crushing his sleeping wife&#x2019;s skull with the ax, he slit her throat with the knife, taking care to drain the blood into a vessel so as not to stain the bedsheets. After covering her face with a handkerchief, he proceeded to the children&#x2019;s room, where he committed the same butchery upon them. He left the little boy lying in bed. The slaughtered girls were placed side by side on the floor, &#x201c;like three lambs,&#x201d; and covered with a blanket.<br><br>Leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the stairs, Beadle then descended to the kitchen, placed the ax and knife&#x2014;&#x201c;reeking with the blood of his family&#x201d;&#x2014;on a table, and seated himself in a Windsor chair by the fireplace. Several weeks earlier, in preparation for this moment, he had brought his two flintlock pistols to the village gunsmith for repair. He now took a pistol in each hand and, supporting his elbows on the arms of the chair, pressed the muzzles against his ears and pulled both triggers simultaneously, &#x201c;splattering his brains against the walls and wainscoting.&#x201d;<br><br>By then, Dr. Farnsworth had been roused from his bed by the maid and handed the note, which &#x201c;announced the diabolical purpose of the writer.&#x201d; Though Farnsworth &#x201c;thought it impossible that a sober man could adopt so horrible a design,&#x201d; he immediately alerted his neighbor, the Hon. Stephen Mix Mitchell, later chief justice of the state. The two men then rushed to the Beadles&#x2019; house, where they were greeted by the &#x201c;tragical scene.&#x201d;<br><br>Before long, news of the atrocity had spread throughout the village. &#x201c;Multitudes of all ages and sexes&#x201d; overran the house for a firsthand look at the carnage. The scene was described by Judge Mitchell, whose narrative account of the &#x201c;horrid massacre&#x201d; became one of the best-selling true crime pamphlets of its day:<br><br>The very inmost souls of the beholders were wounded at the sight and torn by contending passions. Silent grief, with marks of astonishment, were succeeded by furious indignation against the author of the affecting spectacle, which vented itself in incoherent exclamations. Some old soldiers, accidentally passing through the town that morning on their way from camp to visit their friends, led by curiosity, turned in to view the sad remains. On sight of the woman and her tender offspring, notwithstanding all their firmness, the tender sympathetic tear stealing gently down their furrowed cheeks betrayed the anguish of their hearts. On being showed the body of the sacrificer, they paused for a moment, then muttering forth an oath or two of execration, with their eyes fixed on the ground in silent sorrow, they slowly went their way. So awful and terrible a disaster wrought wonderfully on the minds of the neighborhood. Nature itself seemed ruffled and refused the kindly aid of balmly sleep for a time.<br><br>&#x201c;Frantic with indignation and horror at a crime so unnatural and monstrous,&#x201d; the inhabitants of Wethersfield refused to allow its perpetrator a Christian burial. Tying the bloody carving knife to his breast, they dragged him on a small sled to the riverbank, dug a grave in the unconsecrated ground, and tossed his uncoffined body into the hole &#x201c;like the carcass of a beast.&#x201d; A few days later, after deciding that the site was too close to the ferry landing, &#x201c;sundry persons&#x201d; dug up the corpse and transferred it &#x201c;with utmost secrecy&#x201d; to an &#x201c;obscure spot.&#x201d; Despite this precaution, &#x201c;some children accidentally discovered the place.&#x201d; The body was exhumed again and removed to yet another place &#x201c;where it is hoped mankind will have no further vexation with it.&#x201d;<br><br>In stark contrast to the contemptuous treatment of Beadle&#x2019;s corpse, his victims&#x2019; funeral was a ceremonious affair. &#x201c;The remains of the children were borne by a suitable number of equal age, attended with a sad procession of youths of the town, all bathed in tears,&#x201d; wrote one observer. &#x201c;Side by side the hapless woman&#x2019;s corpse was carried in solemn procession to the parish churchyard, followed by a great concourse who, with affectionate concern and every token of respect, were anxious to express their heartfelt sorrow in performing the last mournful duties.&#x201d;<br><br>Though subjected to an ignominious burial, William Beadle was granted a kind of immortality in the form of a widely circulated broadside ballad, illustrated with a woodcut showing a knife-wielding Beadle attacking his children:<br><br>A bloody scene I&#x2019;ll now relate,<br><br>Which lately happen&#x2019;d in a neighboring state<br><br>A murder of the deepest dye, I say,<br><br>O be amaz&#x2019;d for surely well you may.<br><br>A man (unworthy of the name) who slew<br><br>Himself, his consort, and his offspring, too;<br><br>An amiable wife with four children dear,<br><br>Into one grave was put&#x2014;Oh drop a tear!<br><br>Soon in the morning of the fatal day,<br><br>Beadle, the murd&#x2019;rer sent his maid away,<br><br>To tell the awful deed he had in view;<br><br>To their assistance the kind neighbors flew.<br><br>It truly gives me pain for to pen down,<br><br>A deed so black, and yet his mind was sound.<br><br>Says he, &#x201c;I mean to close six persons&#x2019; eyes,<br><br>Through perfect fondness and the tend&#x2019;rest ties.&#x201d;<br><br>Detest the errors to this deed him drew,<br><br>And mourn the hapless victims whom he slew;<br><br>And pray to God that Satan may be bound,<br><br>Since to deceive so many he is found.<br><br>Fly swiftly round, ye circling years,<br><br>Hail the auspicious day,<br><br>When love shall dwell in every heart&#x2014;<br><br>Nor men their offspring slay!<br><br>[Sources: S.

Coverly, 1783).]<br><br>Domestic Slaughter Then And Now<br><br>&#x201c;Something strange and horrible happened in a number of American households of the early republic,&#x201d; writes scholar Daniel Cohen in a groundbreaking study of family annihilators such as William Beadle. &#x201c;In a series of curiously clustered incidents, a handful of men, loving husbands and affectionate fathers, took axes from under their beds, or off their mantelpiece, and slaughtered their wife and children.&#x201d;<br><br>To be sure, though the public was transfixed by reports of these atrocities, the crimes themselves were actually quite rare during the first quarter century of our nation&#x2019;s existence. Cohen himself cites just five instances of familicide&#x2014;&#x201c;the slaughter of an entire family by its patriarchal head&#x201d;&#x2014;between 1781 and 1806. Uxoricide&#x2014;the murder of a wife by her husband&#x2014;was only slightly more common. According to recent research by historian Randolph Roth, &#x201c;In all of New England, only about 35 spouses . . . were murdered before 1800.&#x201d;<br><br>For complex social and cultural reasons, the situation began to change in the early decades of the nineteenth century, when &#x201c;the rate of wife murder increased fivefold&#x201d; throughout the north. At the same time (as crime historian Karen Halttunen shows in her classic book Murder Most Foul), printed accounts of familicide began to appear with increasing frequency, offering detailed descriptions of domestic butchery that sometimes bordered on the pornographic. Moralists who believe that today&#x2019;s popular culture is unusually graphic in its depiction of violence might consider this passage from an 1857 crime pamphlet called The Triple Murderer, recounting the enormities of a midwestern family annihilator named Reuben Ward. After killing his wife Olive, Ward proceeded to dispose of the corpse in the most grisly way imaginable:<br><br>I tore the clothes open from the throat down. I then took a small pocket knife and opened the body, took the bowels out first, and then put them in the stove upon the wood; they being filled with air would make a noise in exploding, so I took my knife and pricked holes through them to prevent the noise; then took out the liver and heart . . . I then took out the blood remaining in the cavity of the body by placing a copper kettle close to the same and cupping it out with my hands . . . I broke off the ribs and took out the breast bone, and threw it into a large boiler; unjointed the arms at the shoulders, doubled them up and placed them in the boiler; then severed the remaining portions of the body by placing a stick of wood under her back and breaking the back bone over the same, cutting away the flesh and ligaments with a knife.</p><h2>The Sonnets and A Lover&#39;s Complaint (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Shakespeare's poetic meditations on love </b><br><br>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' The language of Shakespeare's sonnets has become inseparable from the language of love in English; but the force and tenderness of these poems is undiminished by age. When this volume of Shakespeare's poems first appeared in 1609, he had already written most of the great plays that made him famous. The 154 sonnets - all but two of which are addressed to a beautiful young man, 'Mr W.H.', or a treacherous 'dark lady' - contain some of the most exquisite and haunting poetry ever written, and deal with eternal subjects such as love and infidelity, memory and mortality, and the destruction wreaked by Time. Also included is A Lover's Complaint, originally published with the sonnets, in which a young woman is overheard lamenting her betrayal by a heartless seducer. In his illuminating introduction, John Kerrigan examines how the sonnets are intertwined, the ways in which these works have been interpreted and the themes running through them. This edition also includes further reading, commentaries on each poem, a textual history, variant and further sonnets and an index of first lines.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

P. Lovecraft</b>&nbsp;has since come to be recognized as one of the greatest writers of classic horror, on a par with Edgar Allan Poe, Lovecraft's mentor. H. P. Lovecraft's work has been translated into more than a dozen languages, his tales adapted for film, television, and comic books, and he has been the subject of more scholarly study than any other writer of horror fiction save Poe.Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> Howard Phillips Lovecraft certainly could write. And the many books and stories bearing his byline are ample proof of that.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a world filled with pastiches, spoofs, and sequels (trust me, I know&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve edited a couple of those volumes myself), Lovecraft is the real thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although it has become fashionable by some contemporary critics to decry the author&#x2019;s somewhat archaic and eldritch writing style, there is no doubt that Lovecraft knew exactly what he was doing, and like Edgar Allan Poe&#x2014;who he both admired and now rivals in influence&#x2014;he was an American stylist of the highest order.<br> &nbsp;<br> My own introduction to Lovecraft&#x2019;s work occurred in 1969 when, at the age of sixteen, I came across a paperback edition of Dagon and Other Macabre Tales in a local Woolworth&#x2019;s branch. I was initially attracted to the book by the distinctive black-and-white illustration on the cover, but the stories it contained were a revelation to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Within a year I had tracked down and read every major story Lovecraft had ever written. And despite having collected the author&#x2019;s work in many rare and original editions over the years, I still have the very same copy of that first paperback on my shelf, almost forty years later.<br> However, once I had exhausted Lovecraft&#x2019;s relatively small body of work, I started searching around for other stories in a similar vein.<br> &nbsp;<br> * * *<br> &nbsp;<br> Born in his grandparents&#x2019; house in Providence, Rhode Island, on August 20, 1890, H. P. Lovecraft led a somewhat sheltered life as a child. Because of an apparent nervous disorder, he was treated as a semi-invalid by his protective mother and her indulgent family, and this coddled seclusion allowed the young boy to read a great many books.<br> &nbsp;<br> A lifelong Anglophile as a result of his family&#x2019;s paternal English ancestry, Lovecraft had an old-fashioned writing style that may not have appealed to many contemporary readers, and he was easily discouraged when things did not go his way. Yet, despite all of these tribulations, his work has survived and flourished in the seventy years since his premature death.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is because Lovecraft had an imagination second-to-none. Most famously, he created a pantheon of ancient Gods and alien deities in a series of loosely connected stories that later came to be called the &#x201c;Cthulhu Mythos.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Even during his lifetime, Lovecraft&#x2019;s concepts were added to by an ever-widening circle of writers. It has been argued that Lovecraft did not actively encourage these pastiches, although at first they were mostly written by his friends, correspondents, and fellow writers from the legendary pulp magazine Weird Tales. These, most notably, included August W. Derleth, Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, Clark Ashton Smith, and Frank Belknap Long.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was also Lovecraft&#x2019;s habit to adopt the inventions of his friends&#x2014;such as the names of demonic divinities and cursed tomes of eldritch lore&#x2014;and give them his seal of approval by incorporating them into his own fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, there also exists a converse group of stories that exhibit a much more personal involvement by the author, even if his name invariably did not appear on the originally published byline.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite his devotion to the actual craft of writing, Lovecraft&#x2019;s attitude to his own work often bordered on the dismissive, if not downright lazy. Although he made a meager living as a commercial writer, he rarely considered markets. He was as likely to have his work published in an amateur press publication for little or no reward as he was to see his name on the cover of a newsstand pulp magazine that invariably still only paid its contributors a pittance.<br> &nbsp;<br> In his early twenties Lovecraft became immersed with the amateur journalism movement. He was also an inveterate letter writer, churning out an average of eight to ten letters a day, each usually four to eight pages in length, to a wide circle of correspondents, when he should have been producing more fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> Much of Lovecraft&#x2019;s writing was done in longhand with a fountain pen, and he hated revising or retyping his work (to the extent that others would sometimes do it for him). If a particular story was rejected by a specific market he had submitted it to, Lovecraft would more likely become despondent than try to sell the tale elsewhere: &#x201c;Rejections are so numerous lately that I think I&#x2019;ll stop writing for a while &amp; use the time in revision,&#x201d; he wrote to correspondent August Derleth.<br> &nbsp;<br> As an author he wrote what he wanted, and when that did not pay the bills, he turned to rewriting other people&#x2019;s stories&#x2014;often so extensively that they became wholly his own work.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was the case with &#x201c;The Crawling Chaos,&#x201d; an early dream-narrative written with the amateur poet Winifred Virginia Jackson and published under the double pseudonyms Lewis Theobold, Jr., and Elizabeth Neville Berkley in The United Co-operative, an amateur magazine.<br> &nbsp;<br> With money always tight, and as a method of subsidizing his precarious income, Lovecraft provided a literary revision service, giving advice and suggestions where needed, or completely changing the work of some of his less talented clients. In fact, these (usually uncredited) revisions became Lovecraft&#x2019;s major source of income, with his own fiction merely a sideline. Although much of this work consisted of correcting spelling, punctuation and grammar, or copying out manuscript pages, he would sometimes entirely revise and rewrite a story, retaining only its title or the nucleus of the plot if its content inspired his imagination.<br> &nbsp;<br> Among the amateur authors whose work he substantially rewrote or revised were U.S. consul Adolphe de Castro; family friend and fellow Providence resident C. M. Eddy, Jr.; Lovecraft&#x2019;s future literary executor Robert H. Barlow; writer and editor Wilfred Blanch Talman; midwest journalist and romance writer Zealia B. Bishop; Massachusetts divorc�e Hazel Heald; world traveler William Lumley; Lovecraft&#x2019;s future wife Sonia H. Greene (Davis); and even the famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini (Ehrich Weiss), all of whom went on to sell their fiction to Weird Tales.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He would criticize paragraph after paragraph and pencil remarks beside them,&#x201d; recalled Hazel Heald, &#x201c;and then make me rewrite them until they pleased him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was also through this service that Lovecraft added stories by such writers as Bishop, Heald, Lumley, and Frank Belknap Long to the burgeoning &#x201c;Cthulhu Mythos.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The stories I sent him always came back so revised from their basic idea that I felt I was a complete failure as a writer,&#x201d; Zealia Bishop remembered. &#x201c;As a writer and instructor in the field of supernatural fiction he was an undisputed master, and another&#x2019;s work seldom pleased him when he first saw it. He could always find much to improve, and he was generous with his advice, drawing on a vast store of knowledge quite beyond the capacity of the average man of education of his or our time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bishop felt so grateful to Lovecraft that when her story &#x201c;Medusa&#x2019;s Coil&#x201d; ultimately appeared in the January 1939 issue of Weird Tales, she stipulated that half the fee ($120) should be paid to his surviving aunt, Annie E. P. Gamwell. &#x201c;My debt to Lovecraft is great,&#x201d; Bishop admitted. &#x201c;I count myself fortunate that I was one of his epistolary friends and pupils.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Horror in the Museum contains some of the best of these &#x201c;revisions&#x201d; or, as they should more properly be called, &#x201c;collaborations.&#x201d; If not quite up to the standard of Lovecraft&#x2019;s own finest work, such tales as C. M. Eddy&#x2019;s controversial &#x201c;The Loved Dead,&#x201d; Robert H. Barlow&#x2019;s &#x201c;Till A&#x2019; the Seas,&#x201d; Hazel Heald&#x2019;s &#x201c;Out of the Aeons&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Horror in the Burying-Ground,&#x201d; William Lumley&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Diary of Alonzo Typer,&#x201d; and Zealia Bishop&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Curse of Yig,&#x201d; &#x201c;Medusa&#x2019;s Coil,&#x201d; and the short novel &#x201c;The Mound,&#x201d; along with the title story itself, are all worthy of being considered minor gems in the canon of weird fiction. This is not really so surprising when you recognize that, as August Derleth so succinctly pointed out, &#x201c;Lovecraft wrote most of what is mem orable in them!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But for me, the greatest thrill of buying this book when I was still a teenager was discovering that I shared my name (and its particular spelling) with the doomed protagonist of the Lovecraft-Hazel Heald collaboration &#x201c;The Horror in the Museum.&#x201d; Not only that, but the story is atypically set in London&#x2014;just across the River Thames from where I was born!<br> &nbsp;<br> Reading this tale, I have never felt closer to the writer whose work helped shaped my own career in the field of macabre fiction.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Trim Made Simple: A Book and Step-by-Step Companion DVD (Made Simple (Taunton Press))</h2><p><p>Watch.

It seems the Russians have warned the U.S. of an assassination plot against the U.S. president on a visit to Mexico City. The Russians say the plot was hatched in China. Filiberto is assigned to work with Russian and American spooks to stop it. While the Cold War adversaries warily measure each other, Filiberto begins to rattle cages in Chinatown, even as he pursues Marta, a beautiful young Chinese woman. His cage rattling immediately produces &#x201c;stiffs.&#x201d; His efforts to bed Marta turn unexpectedly, uncharacteristically, and humorously chivalrous. Bernal published this noir in Mexico in 1969, presaging Paco Ignacio Taibo&#x2019;s H�ctor Belascoar�n Shayne and Ken Bruen&#x2019;s tormented ex-Garda, Jack Taylor. The usually dyspeptic Filiberto narrates, and his angry screeds about, well, almost everything recall Taylor&#x2019;s anguished and funny rants. His ideas also reflect Shayne&#x2019;s indictments of Mexican government corruption and repression.

He still suffers from shell shock, and his mentor hopes that a journey Robert had always wanted to make&#x2014;to find his family roots along the banks of the River Shannon&#x2014;will restore his equilibrium and his vocation. But there is more to the story: On his return from the war, Robert had witnessed startling corruption in the Archdiocese of Boston. He has been sent to Ireland to secure his silence&#x2014;permanently. As Robert faces the dangers of a strife-torn Ireland roiling in civil war, the nation&#x2019;s myths and people, its beliefs and traditions, unfurl healingly before him. And the River Shannon gives comfort to the young man who is inspired by the words of his&nbsp;mentor: &#x201c;Find your soul and you&#x2019;ll live.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Frank Delaney</b>&nbsp;is the author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling novel&nbsp;<i>Ireland</i>, as well as&nbsp;<i>The Last Storyteller, The Matchmaker of Kenmare, Venetia Kelly&#x2019;s Traveling Show, Tipperary, Shannon,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Simple Courage: A True Story of Peril on the Sea.</i>&nbsp;A former judge for the Man Booker Prize, Delaney enjoyed a prominent career in BBC broadcasting before becoming a full-time writer. Delaney died in 2017.Chapter 1<br><br>At the vulnerable age of thirty, Robert Shannon lost his soul. Nothing is worse; no greater danger exists. Only sinners lose their souls, it&#x2019;s said, through the evil that they do. Not Robert Shannon. Incapable of anything but good, he lost his soul through savagery that he witnessed, horrors that he saw. And then, as he was repairing himself and his beliefs, he was ravaged further in the pursuit of his own faith.<br><br>When you ?lose&#x2014;?or have ripped from ?you&#x2014;?the spirit that directs you, you have two options. Fight for your soul and win it back, and you&#x2019;ll evermore be a noble human being. Fail, and you die from loss of truth.<br><br>And so, just before dawn one morning in 1922, Robert Shannon stood on the deck of a slow old freighter on the southwest coast of Ireland and looked inland. This was the point to which he had come in search of his lost best self. If he could have explained clearly what he was doing, he would have said that he wanted to find the man he had been. If he could have described lucidly the essence of his journey across the Atlantic, he would have expressed the wish that here, in the country of his forebears, some ancient magic of ancestry might restore him. Could it be that in the old land, of which he had so often dreamed, he might find, to begin with, hope? But what he desperately needed to rediscover was belief.<br><br>On the port side, the western hills slept low and dark; to starboard rose the tall and ragged box of a ruined castle. A lighthouse came gliding into view, its lantern&#x2019;s beam fading against the opening skies. These were sights he had expected to see, and as they approached they comforted ?him&#x2014;?insofar as he could feel comfort. The dark rocks, though watching carefully, offered no threat, and the freighter steamed in, composed now in the estuary&#x2019;s calm after weeks of coping with the burly sea.<br><br>Find your soul and you&#x2019;ll live.<br><br>Ashore, colors began to wake up and stretch. A gray triangle became a lawn of green. In a whitewashed cottage wall, a dark oblong shape developed into a turquoise door. The large house on the hill strengthened from gray to yellow. In a sloping field, ?black-?and-? white cows drifted, heavy and swaying, toward their gate, expecting to be milked.<br><br>Forward of the ship, seabirds flapped up from the little waves. On a rock a cormorant waited, an etching in black angles. The spreading river shone like gray satin; later it would turn sapphire under the blue sky.<br><br>As the light brightened, the captain came and stood at the rail with his lone passenger, for whom he had to find a clear mooring in this uncertain place. Once having landed this man safely and well, he could take the freighter back into the channel.<br><br>Not for the first time, Captain Aaronson heard his passenger murmur something and sigh.<br><br>The square tower of the village church remained in shadow. Despite the ?half-?light, the ship discovered the little old pier, made a wide curve, and chugged in. Disembarkation took no more than a few minutes. The seamen dropped a ladder over the side, and the passenger took the captain&#x2019;s hand as though he wished to keep it.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Captain. For your&#x201d;&#x2014;he ?halted&#x2014;?&#x201c;for ?your&#x2014;?such kindness.&#x201d;<br><br>Without a further word he turned and, with his back to the waiting land, and made hunchbacked by his large rucksack, he descended the ladder. When his feet touched the jetty, he stood for a moment; indeed, he clung to the ladder. Then he took a step backward and turned away.<br><br>Looking down from the rail, the captain and some crewmen watched him lurch off, this man who had rarely spoken to them. As one said, &#x201c;He spooked us all,&#x201d; because he moved around so silently. He&#x2019;d slipped and slid with the roll of the sea. He&#x2019;d taken the rain in his face like a man trying to wake up. He&#x2019;d inhaled deeply the harsh and icy air through which they had sometimes sailed.<br><br>The few seamen who had tried speaking to him had learned nothing. Often the changing watch met him as he ghosted around the decks in the smallest hours of the night. To their greeting he cast down his eyes and stepped aside to let them pass. Among themselves they talked about him without cease. Was he a criminal on the run? Was he a fugitive from the recent German war? Was he being put ashore for secret political reasons? Was he an Irish spy?<br><br>Only the captain, a tough little Dutchman, knew anything. He knew why the young traveler remained silent, his pale face closed. The tall distinguished man who had instructed Captain Aaronson in the port of Boston had indicated that his passenger would have little wish to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;Ask him no questions,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He has seen too much.&#x201d;<br><br>On a shouted order, two seamen hauled up the ladder. The ship&#x2019;s engine growled on the air. Within minutes she was back in the stretch of the river they call Tarbert Roads, chugging her way up to Limerick.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what he was saying to himself?&#x201d; the mate asked the captain.<br><br>&#x201c;No, I could not so well hear.&#x201d;<br><br>But Captain Aaronson was lying. He&#x2019;d heard perfectly well what the passenger had ?said&#x2014;?what he had murmured over and over.<br><br>Lose your soul and you&#x2019;ll die.<br><br>The young American walked no more than a few yards, then stopped and looked back. His arms hung loose; his body sagged like a puppet&#x2019;s; the haversack dragged his shoulders down. He gazed after the departing ship and gasped.<br><br>Come back! Don&#x2019;t leave me!<br><br>For several minutes he remained in that one place. A harsh bird went ? craik-?craik. Mottled hanks of weed, green as the hair of a witch, flopped against the old stone wedges of the jetty. The young man patted his cheeks as if disbelieving the gentleness of the morning air. Once upon a time this would have been a moment for a prayer, especially as the sky was now brightening fast.<br><br>On the evidence of his appearance, this man was neither a farmer nor a laborer; his face was too unweathered, too strained, too pale. Nor was he a clerk or a lawyer; his eyes showed no calm, no control. Could he have been a performer of some sort, an actor, a singer? No, he had no authority in his stance, neither in his body nor in his walk. A doctor? Not at all, no hint of concern. A teacher, perhaps? A leader of men?<br><br>Not anymore. This man had been ?shattered&#x2014;?by war. The systems he had learned since his birth, in his years of impressive education, in the outstanding conduct of his own ?life&#x2014;?they had all seized and failed and he had become silent, incapable, trapped. Those ropes by which we all pull ourselves forward through the world were, in his life, as thin as cotton threads.<br><br>Find your soul and you&#x2019;ll live. That&#x2019;s why he had come here. Robert Shannon was a Catholic priest, born and raised in the white towns of New England. He had ministered as a beloved pastor; from there he had gone forth to become a war hero: Captain Robert Shannon, a chaplain with the U.S. Marines. With his deeds no more now than somebody else&#x2019;s fable, some handwritten and classified reports in a regimental archive, some family letters full of pride, he walked along that anonymous Irish foreshore because, as is the case with so many heroes, nobody knew for certain what to do with him.<br><br>Those few who cared for Father ?Shannon&#x2014;?his parents, his mentor in the Church, his ?doctor&#x2014;?wished devoutly to keep him alive. But they also knew that, given his infirm emotions, he stood in danger of taking his own ?life&#x2014;?especially if he remained in New England. And, as if all this was not enough, there were ?those&#x2014;?unknown to his ? guardians&#x2014;?who would soon get ready to help him die, because he had indeed seen too much.<br><br>Shannon was setting out with a simple aim. There had always been Irish pride in his family, a deep and good sense of belonging to a great and ancient ?race&#x2014;?and to a family that got its name from the Shannon River. The ancestors who came to America in the 1700s had reputedly lived on its banks; a painting of a Shannon River scene hung in the family&#x2019;s hallway. And where young Robert Shannon&#x2019;s friends and contemporaries had newspaper prints of sports stars or horses on their walls, this boy had filled his bedroom with Irish memorabilia, including the large map he now carried in his rucksack.<br><br>?Shell-?shock victims, it had been found, often used childhood memories to anchor themselves. Amid his newfound terrors and rages, Father Shannon had found again the great shining force of childhood tales. From deep inside him, he had managed to haul out the emotional force to believe, to trust, that this storied river could heal him. To possess such a mighty ?name&#x2014;?that must add up to something, mustn&#x2019;t it?<br><br>Now, at last, he would embrace the river. Simply and determinedly, he would hike north on the east bank of the Shannon, visit the very source, the dark pool of its birth, and walk back south on the west bank. Somewhere along the way he would step into the early footprints of his people. And, his blood rekindled, he would return to the point opposite this morning&#x2019;s landing at Tarbert and, on a day yet to be decided, join a ship to take him home again. In planning this journey he had found what he needed most at that point in his ?life&#x2014;?focus.<br><br>Truth to tell, he had grasped little else for some years. Most days he had no more than a fractured knowledge of himself, nothing greater than a jagged sense of his confused mind. On better mornings he glimpsed a snapshot of the man he had once been. Like a battlefield flare, it lit the sky of his mind, but he ?hadn&#x2019;t the mental power to prolong the brilliance, and it fell away. On such occasions he seemed almost normal for a time, but the effort fatigued him. And on the very worst days he merely succumbed to the remembered trauma of the battlefield and lay down. This morning, exhausted from the ship and unsure of his ability to make this journey, he looked as he had done so often in the past few years: three quarters broken and greatly lost.<br><br>But if all went well&#x2014;if the green stillness of Ireland brought recovery, if the river healed him, if in his roots he found the way back to himself&#x2014;he could resume his true life. This belief, based solely on hope, gave him such little energy as he felt.<br><br>He also had beneath him a curious safety net, a network set up by his mentor, an odd fish of an archbishop named Sevovicz. In order to manage the known ?factors&#x2014;?Father Shannon&#x2019;s fragility, his exhausting struggle to recover himself, his sudden ?outbursts&#x2014;?and to try to guard against possibilities yet unknown, Archbishop Sevovicz had written in some detail to the Irish bishops whose dioceses touched the Shannon. These men had then contacted the priests in their multiple parishes, and thus, all along the river, on the thick red line that the young man had drawn on his boyhood map of Ireland, local Irish people waited, talking to one another about him, watching out for him, willing to help him take his anxious steps. Father Shannon knew nothing of this.<br><br>From Tarbert Pier a broad lap of the river nudges in toward the rear of the village. With this inlet to his left, past the old stone jail to his right, and up the sloping road, the young priest reached the crossroads. Here he turned left. In these houses slept O&#x2019;Connors, MacCormacks, O&#x2019;Flahertys, Kennellys, as they do today and as they&#x2019;ve done since before Christ was born. Nothing moved, no sign of life. Tarbert has a long main street; ahead stretched empty distance. He took a deep breath.<br><br>Clear of the houses, he stopped by a great beech tree. Below, to his left, the departing freighter had left a small foaming wake that gleamed in the last of the early shadows. To get a clearer view he stepped into the rough land at the side of the road, made his way down the slope a few paces, and stood for several minutes gazing out over the brambles and scrub.<br><br>Dawn came down the river from the east. The day would grow sunny and warm, a good start, and everything he saw offered the first signs of peacefulness. Yes, it might be all right here.<br><br>The estuary feathered a little under a slight breeze, but it looked calm and supple, reassuringly level after that bully, the Atlantic. He lingered, then climbed back up to the road and faced ahead.<br><br>And then he ?stopped&#x2014;?halted abruptly. Before him in the roadway stood three men, two of them seemingly much younger than himself. They carried rifles; they wore bandoliers. He glanced behind him to check whether they had ?companions&#x2014;?and the gunmen turned and saw him. No hiding now. Shannon stepped away from the great beech tree and into the roadway.<br><br>The Great War began in the golden fall of 1914, one of western Europe&#x2019;s most beautiful Septembers ever. Within weeks the conflict took on a shape never seen before: massive artillery bombardments raining down upon men huddled in ?head-?high trenches. Little more than a year later the medical journals of western Europe, with palpable consternation, began to discuss a new condition reported from the battlefield. The doctors had no name for it; they called it nerve strain or war strain or even hysteria or war shock. Eventually, by means of general usage, they settled on what they agreed was a popular but inadequate title: shell shock.<br><br>Over the four or so years of the war, doctors began internationally to define shell shock by the suddenly altered behavior of the soldiers and the lasting impact on victims&#x2019; minds. Reports emerged from France, Germany, Russia, Britain, and the United States. The afflicted troops numbered in thousands, maybe tens of thousands, and no two cases were identical.</p><h2>Yolanda Lopez (A Ver)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;It is important for us to be visually literate; it is a survival skill.

As a young, na�ve correspondent for <i>The Stars and Stripes</i>, Rooney flew bomber missions, arrived in France during the D-Day invasion, crossed the Rhine with the Allied forces, traveled to Paris for the Liberation, and was one of the first reporters into Buchenwald. Like so many of his generation, Rooney's life was changed forever by the war. He saw life at the extremes of human experience, and wrote about what he observed, making it real to millions of men and women. <i>My War</i> is the story of an inexperienced kid learning the craft of journalism. It is by turns moving, suspenseful, and reflective. And Rooney's unmistakable voice shines through on every page.</p><p>On July 7, 1941, a young Colgate University football player named Andy Rooney reported for U.S. Army training. He was, Rooney allows, not prime military material. He had a knack for enraging the drill instructors with his wisecracks, and for pulling harsh assignments as a result, and his shenanigans got him disqualified from officer candidacy. Still, Rooney survived boot camp and served for a time as an artilleryman until being reassigned to the daily newspaper <i>Stars and Stripes</i>. Lucky for him, too: in 1942 his old outfit ran into trouble in North Africa, fighting against Erwin Rommel, and although few of them were killed, Rooney writes, "there's a good possibility I would have spent all of 1943, 1944, and six months of 1945 in a German prison camp."<p> In <i>My War</i>, a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir, Rooney--later to gain fame as a <i>60 Minutes</i> commentator--recounts what happened instead. As a correspondent, he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin. What he witnessed will perhaps not please some survivors and students of the war, especially those who revere Gen. George S. Patton--whom Rooney charges with having committed improprieties, injustices, and even war crimes in the quest to secure personal fame.</p><p> Though the book is a personal memoir, Rooney has taken pains to square his anecdotes with the historical record. However, he writes, "It is distressing for me to note how infrequently the facts concur with my memory of what happened." (In such cases, he adds, he assumes that the facts are wrong.) Affecting, occasionally disturbing, and thoroughly well-written, Rooney's memoir is a welcome addition to the literature of "the good war." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>ca&#39;s favorite commentators writes a moving, funny, and highly evocative account of his life as an Army private and Stars and Stripes reporter during World War II.

The wining poems called Mu&#x2019;allaq�t, or Hanging Odes, were embroidered in gold on banners and suspended from the walls of Arabia&#x2019;s most sacred shrine, Ka&#x2019;ba. Desert Tracings is a translation of six classical sixth to eighth century odes. Arabic codes (qasidas) traditionally begin with the relationship of the lover to the loved. Usually set at opening in the beloved&#x2019;s abandoned desert campsite, where the only evidence that remains is tent marks and torrent beds in the sand &#x2013; &#x201c;naked tracings,/ worn thin, like inscriptions/ carved in flat stones&#x201d; &#x2013; the qasida moves gracefully through the thematic parts, the lover&#x2019;s grief, the quest, and the final acceptance of a world deprived of the beloved. Like the oryx-doe trapped within the unyielding cycles of the desert world.<br><br>As Michael Sells writes in his introduction, the qasidahas been overshadowed in the West by other Arabic literature, such as The Arabian Nights, but the qasidais are the primary literary tradition in both pre-Islamic and Islamic Arabia.

The pilot banked sharply, slowing to eighty knots, then turned on the carburetor heat and powered back to 1500 rpm. When he made the field, he extended another ten degrees of flaps, dropped his airspeed to seventy, and corrected for the crosswind that blew off the cliff to the west. He powered back, leveled off, and touched down at the end of the grassy north-south strip. The landing was bumpy but no rougher than usual. He regularly mowed the private strip tucked into the Bee Creek valley at the foot of Sycamore Mountain and knew where to avoid the worst of the hummocks and dips. He powered down, braked lightly, and taxied the short distance to the Quonset hut that served as an airplane hangar. Glad to be back in Texas, he climbed out and was greeted by the man who had just come out of the barn.</p><p>&#x201c;Where the hell you been?&#x201d; the man demanded angrily. &#x201c;I been expecting you for hours.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;Ever&#x2019; time you go up in that antique bolt-bucket, you could come home in a body bag.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; the pilot said. &#x201c;She may be an antique, but she&#x2019;s still in the air. And I don&#x2019;t notice her condition keeping you from taking her up whenever you feel like it.&#x201d; It was true. Both of them flew the plane, although its certification had lapsed long ago. The pilot paused to flick a light to his cigarette. &#x201c;Stopped off outside of Lubbock to say hi to a little girl I know there. Took longer than I thought. Sorry,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;Shoulda called.&#x201d; He grinned, remembering. &#x201c;Guess I had something else on my mind.&#x201d;</p><p>The two men were brothers, but there was no family resemblance. In his late thirties, the pilot was sandy-haired, short, and barrel-chested, broad and heavy across the shoulders. His younger brother was thin and dark, with a disfiguring knife scar that ran across his narrow cheek and under his ear, earned in a barroom fight in Corpus Christi a few years before. Both wore cowboy hats and jackets&#x2014;the pilot denim, his brother a green army field jacket&#x2014;jeans, and scuffed cowboy boots.</p><p>&#x201c;Lubbock,&#x201d; his brother grunted. &#x201c;I just might have to shoot you.&#x201d; Both men laughed. They pushed the plane into the hangar and went swiftly through the usual postflight items. They were both good fliers, both good mechanics. Had to be, since they didn&#x2019;t have the money to pay somebody else to keep the plane flying.</p><p>&#x201c;You heard from the truck?&#x201d; the pilot asked as they closed the big doors. &#x201c;Jack loaded up and got off before dawn. I told him to phone you with updates.&#x201d; Jack was their partner. He worked on another ranch, but he&#x2019;d taken a few days off to do the job.</p><p>&#x201c;Phoned twice. Last time he&#x2019;d got as far as Lampasas, coming down 281. Should be pulling in&#x2014;&#x201d; He looked at his watch, &#x201c;Give him another hour, maybe. That trailer work out okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It loads better than the old one and rides smoother, but six white-tails are still more than I like to handle. Those animals panic real easy.&#x201d; The pilot paused, considering. &#x201c;This was a real good batch, though. Big, solid bucks, hundred seventy pounds each, maybe fifty percent bigger than the wild bucks on the range around here.&#x201d;</p><p>Size was the thing, of course. If you were trying to establish a game ranch, the native deer made pretty sorry breeding stock. Bucks averaged around eighty-five, ninety pounds on good range, and with the drought, most range was only fair to poor. So you either laid out big dollars to rent stud bucks from the breeders or bought their semen at seven, eight thousand dollars a pop.</p><p>But he and his brother didn&#x2019;t have that kind of money. Their dad would rise up out of his grave and come gunning for them if he knew they had mortgaged the family land to high fence most of it. When they got enough money together, they could finish the job and apply for their deer breeder permit. Which was why they were bringing in the Oklahoma animals. And that was taking a big risk, since Texas had passed a law a few years ago making it a felony to haul deer in from other states. Scared of &#x201c;wasting disease,&#x201d; they claimed, although everybody knew it was just the big white-tail breeders protecting their business from out-of-state competition. The feds had gotten in on the act, too, and passed a law against illegally transporting deer.</p><p>But first they had to catch you. The pilot figured the chances of that were pretty slim, all things considered. He knew of a team up in North Texas that had been running a similar black market operation for the past five years, bringing in deer from up north, from Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin. They were still in business, making money hand over fist. All he and his brother needed were a couple of good trips to stock the ranch, and then they&#x2019;d have their herd and could make it legal.</p><p>&#x201c;Antlers?&#x201d; his brother asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Jack&#x2019;s bringing them.&#x201d; The antlers were always removed for transport, to keep the animals from injuring themselves or one another. &#x201c;Impressive racks, obviously superior genetics.&#x201d; That was the buzzword, what everybody was talking about these days. Superior genetics, meaning genes for monster racks that hunters would pay big money for.</p><p>&#x201c;I figure we can keep the best buck,&#x201d; the pilot added, &#x201c;and find breeders who&#x2019;ll pay six thousand apiece for the rest, easy. Seven or eight, maybe more, once they see those racks.&#x201d; There were breeders out there who had more money than sense and were perfectly willing&#x2014;eager, even&#x2014;to buy black-market animals. And there was almost no risk. They knew they could simply launder those deer into the herds already on their hunting compounds, where they&#x2019;d bring tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>His brother nodded. &#x201c;About time for a beer, wouldn&#x2019;t you say? You can tell me all about that little girl in Lubbock.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drink to that,&#x201d; the pilot replied, and the two headed up the hill toward the ranch house, their boots kicking up dry dust. It had rained in the valley over the weekend, but not up here on the mountain. That was the way in this drought. Hit-and-miss, mostly miss.</p><p>The tin-roofed clapboard house was weathered to a dull, nondescript gray. It had served as the family ranch house for four generations now, going back to the days when the only way to get to the Bar Bee was to ride your horse or drive your wagon from the main road up the limestone bed of the shallow Frio River to the spot where the ranch road headed off up Bee Creek. When the river was in flood, you stayed where you were until it was down again. Now, it was paved from the highway near Concan almost all the way up to the Bar Bee, and some of the old ranches were now gated communities with riverfront parks and underground electricity. The pilot hated the thought, but there was no denying it. Pretty quick, they were going to run out of country.</p><p>The two men went in through the back door. Inside, the house reflected its occupancy by a pair of bachelors, neither of whom bothered to make beds or wash dishes on a regular schedule. The kitchen table still held the remains of the previous day&#x2019;s meals, and the sink was piled with dirty pots and pans. The main feature in the living room was a gigantic HDTV, with a pair of brown La-Z-Boys parked in front of it, a table between them topped with an overflowing ashtray and a couple of empty beer bottles.</p><p>They took Lone Star longnecks out of the fridge, then went to sit in the rocking chairs on the front porch, propping their boots on the rail. From this vantage point, they could look out over the nearly two thousand acres of the old ranch, hillsides densely wooded with mesquite, cedar, and oak, the creek bottom with sycamore, pecan, and cypress, and enough open grazing to support a couple of hundred cows. Their dad and granddad had been cattle ranchers, so the whole place was low fenced&#x2014;high fenced now to confine the deer herd they were intent on building. This was the southern rim of the Edwards Plateau and good land, all of it, prime habitat for wild turkey, dove, feral hogs, and white-tailed deer. When they were boys, the brothers had hunted every inch of it. There was no other place on earth that either of them would ever want to be, and when their dad was dying, they&#x2019;d promised him that they would keep the land.</p><p>But cattle ranching was a losing proposition these days. Beef was bringing a good price, but the years-long drought had reduced the amount of hay they could raise to feed their cows, so they&#x2019;d had to sell off most of the calves. The pilot had even thought of selling the plane, but he knew they wouldn&#x2019;t get what it was worth to them. He and his brother had talked the subject up one end and down the other and had come to the conclusion that they either had to sell the land to a developer or turn it into a trophy-hunting ranch, like the one Jack worked for. Which was what they were doing. Give them another two years and enough black-market deer to pay for the rest of the fencing, and they&#x2019;d be in business.</p><p>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the stock count now, with this batch coming in?&#x201d; the pilot asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Eleven from out of state, plus those four fawns Jack brought over. We sold off five of the Oklahoma bucks already.&#x201d;</p><p>The pilot frowned. Jack, who was experienced at working with white-tails, was buying into their project on shares, with breeder fawns and other stuff: supplies, tools, equipment.</p><p>&#x201c;Those fawns,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;they&#x2019;re a problem. Once the Oklahoma white-tails are inside our fence, they could be native to the place and legal, far as anybody can tell. But I don&#x2019;t care how big a rack their daddy carries, those fawns were a mistake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Those ear tattoos. Since it&#x2019;s the genetics we&#x2019;re after, we won&#x2019;t need the animals themselves, once we&#x2019;ve got their offspring. We can get rid of them. And when Jack brings the next batch come spring, they better be unmarked. No more tattooed ears.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go for that,&#x201d; the pilot said, and tipped his bottle. &#x201c;You told him, I reckon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but he&#x2019;s got another problem, too. His wife is pissed off about what he&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d; The brother&#x2019;s voice had a jagged edge. &#x201c;I told him he&#x2019;d better keep her in line, or else.&#x201d; His laugh was raspy. &#x201c;Women. They got their uses, but they&#x2019;re never happy, no matter what. It&#x2019;s always something with them. Always something.&#x201d;</p><p>Or else what, the pilot wondered uneasily, trying not to remember the details of that bad scene in Corpus that had ended with his brother spending five years in jail for manslaughter, plus probation. He eyed the Cooper&#x2019;s hawk circling over the meadow that sloped down to the creek below and watched as it arched into a steep, stooping dive, pulling up sharply with a struggling shape in its brutal claws. Or else what?</p><p>With a shiver, he stopped remembering Corpus and thought instead about Jack&#x2019;s wife, who was a tempting dish. &#x201c;Always something,&#x201d; he agreed mildly.</p><p>His brother pulled out a can of Red Man and poked a wad of tobacco into his cheek. &#x201c;You got it. Well, there&#x2019;s more. The day you and Jack left for Oklahoma, I had to get the vet out here. Not our regular, but the old guy. The one Dad used to go fishing with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah. Him and Dad was real close. Which cow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The red heifer. She twinned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It go okay?&#x201d; The pilot thought it probably had, even though it was a first birth. They had grown up with cows and knew how to deal with most situations. Must have been a tough one for his brother to call in a vet.</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. The bull calf died&#x2014;the vet&#x2019;s damn fault, although he wouldn&#x2019;t own up to it.&#x201d; He narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s worse. While he was here, I think he got a look at those fawns.&#x201d;</p><p>The pilot sat up straight, feeling a twist of uneasiness. &#x201c;A good look?&#x201d;</p><p>His brother shrugged. &#x201c;That old man is shrewd, and he knows our place from way back.&#x201d; There was that jagged edge again. &#x201c;He likely knows we ain&#x2019;t got a permit.&#x201d;</p><p>The pilot didn&#x2019;t say anything for a moment. Then, casual and soothing, he said, &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t reckon he&#x2019;ll say anything. Not his business.&#x201d;</p><p>The brother picked up a rusty can and spit a stream of tobacco juice into it. &#x201c;I been thinking of having a little talk with him.&#x201d;</p><p>The pilot didn&#x2019;t answer for a moment. Then, carefully, trying to be cool, he said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should do that. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Leave it to me, bro. I&#x2019;ll take care of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; the pilot said reluctantly. &#x201c;Well, okay.&#x201d;</p><p>The hawk was back in the air, circling for another kill. He thought again of Corpus Christi.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>American bittersweet, Celastrus scandens, is a climbing vine that can grow to twenty feet. A native, it is reported to occur throughout most of the eastern two-thirds of North America, from Canada to Texas. Other common names include climbing bittersweet, false bittersweet, climbing orangeroot, fevertwig, fever-twitch, staff vine, and Jacob&#x2019;s ladder. It prefers a sunny location and neutral soil. As a climber, it is a valuable ornamental landscape plant that can control erosion and harbor wildlife. Its orange berrylike fruits are produced in late summer and autumn, in hanging clusters that provide winter food for grouse, pheasant, quail, rabbit, squirrel, and deer. Fruit-bearing branches and twigs are prized for holiday wreaths and dried arrangements.</p><p>If you plan to add this vine to your landscape, be sure to choose the native American bittersweet, rather than the invasive pest Oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), which is sometimes sold in nurseries. Aggressive Oriental bittersweet vines can girdle and smother trees and shrubs and have overwhelmed entire plant communities. This imported plant bully not only outcompetes and displaces our indigenous American bittersweet, but can also hybridize with it. Widespread hybridization could genetically disrupt the native bittersweet population to the point of extinction. In some states, Oriental bittersweet has been listed as a prohibited noxious weed and targeted for eradication.</p><p>China Bayles<br>&#x201c;Native Plants for Wildlife Gardens&#x201d;<br>Pecan Springs Enterprise</p><p>Sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to know just when and where a particular story begins. Once you know the ending, you can trace it back to a dozen different starting points, places where you can say, &#x201c;It all started here,&#x201d; or &#x201c;This is where it began.&#x201d; But that&#x2019;s not the whole of it, either&#x2014;because each of those starting points is the ending of another story, which has a beginning somewhere else, which is the ending of yet another story.

But in this classic work, Christian philosopher and statesman Elton Trueblood reveals how Lincoln's leadership skills flowed directly from his religious convictions&#x2014;which explains how the president was able to combine what few leaders can hold together: moral resoluteness with a shrewd ability to compromise; confidence in his cause while refusing to succumb to the traps of self-righteousness or triumphalism; and a commitment to victory while never losing sight of his responsibility for&#x2014;or the humanity of&#x2014;his enemy. These rich meditations offer deep wisdom and insight on one of the most effective leaders of all time. </p></p><p><p>Elton Trueblood (1900-1994) wrote several bestselling religious titles and taught philosophy at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana. </p>&#x201c;One of the most fascinating and revealing pictures of Lincoln ever published.&#x201d; (Floyd S.

Written between 1979 and 1980 while pregnant with her third child, Mayer extends her imaginative letters into meditations for us all on life as it is lived in real time, with its responsibilities and manifold desires. Fierce, lyrical, intimate, and wise, both new and familiar readers, both mothers and non-mothers, will find this book beckoning again and again to offer delicious writing, timely information, consolation, and advice.</p><p>BERNADETTE MAYER was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1945. A prolific poet, her first book was published when she was twenty-three years old. Now, many texts later, she continues to write progressive poetry from her home in East Nassau, New York.<p>"Bernadettes Mayer's Poetry is untamed, word-loving, thought-bending, scientific, able-bodied, funny, generous, honest, and fearless. She is also a supreme formalist, especially when her poems are at their most playful and unpredictable. That is, she possesses a unique and an exemplary grammar of loving. Mayer has delivered a libertine vision of the last most free site--the home world. And it's deep, filled with everyday life, children, landlords, laundry, bills, food, dollar stores, and lovers. Sometimes when I am reading Bernadette Mayer's work I can't tell if she has a broken heart in a fierce world or a fierce heart in a broken world. I suspect it is the latter. The Desires of Mothers to Please Others in Letters is a masterwork."--Peter Gizzi "Publishers Weekly"</p> <p>"Bernadette Mayer's influential epistolary invention was written during a period of emergent, unbounded feminist literary experimentation and in the context of a vital New York School and East Coast poetic community. The republican of these adventurous, audacious, time-based, culturally critical, and sociable writings reawakens a sense of what's possible in poetry, between the freedom of improvisation and the predetermination of constraint. Mayer's invocation of the philosophical question of the other as an indeterminate aspect of the actuality and concept of mother is particularly compelling to this reader as is her durational attempt to get at about the bearing of children before they are born. This desire writing however is also, if not foremost, an event of sentences. Mayer's sentences stretch, heap, languish in densities, launch into anecdote, adjust a perspective, represent realities, compel judgment, rush past the stop, encourage self-awareness, and offer themselves to the pleasure of others."--Carla Harryman "Publishers Weekly"</p> <p>"This new publication restores to print a vital text from Mayer a powerful treatise about balancing identities and conceiving both children and works of art. The long collection, originally published in 1994, assembles unsent letters drafted between summer 1979 and February 1980, during Mayer's third pregnancy--apostrophes to the living and the dead that are openly preoccupied with this new birth. Pregnancy contemplation swells to surround topics of femininity, female bodies, and what it means to be both mother and poet...Stylistically, the work holds true to Mayer's unmistakable voice, ringing with a musicality that arises through her irregular prose grammar. These forms are a foil to much of this work; the normality of pregnancy and the ordinariness of domestic life--"We have a house and it has nine rooms!"--become meaningfully heightened by Mayer's delivery of such personally specific lines. Poetry or prose, epistles or pregnancy guide; from any perspective, Mayer's rediscovered work delivers the goods."-- "Publishers Weekly"</p> <p>"What if we could write poetry at the very same moment we live our lives? What if we could use imagination and language to speak all sides of our mind to all of the others who we love?

D. Wright), often cited as a Nobel contender and one of Europe's most revered poets. On its publication in 1969, it took Denmark by storm, winning critical praise and becoming a huge popular favorite. Translated into many languages, <em>it</em> won international acclaim and is now a classic of modern Scandinavian poetry.<br><br><em>it</em> is both a collection of poems and a single poetic epic, forming a philosophical statement on the nature of language, perception, and reality. The subject matter, though, is down to earth: amoebas, stones, and factories; fear, sea urchins, and mental institutions; sand, sexuality, and song. The words and images of <em>it</em> recur in ways reminiscent of Christensen's other works, but here is a younger poetry, wilder, and crackling with energy. The marvelous and complex use of mathematical structure in <em>it</em> is faithfully captured in Susanna Nied's English translation, which won a 2005 PEN Translation Fund Award.</p><p><p><strong>Inger Christensen</strong> (1935&#x2013; 2009), whose work is a cornerstone of modern Scandinavian poetry, was the recipient of many international awards, among them the Nordic Authors&#x2019; Prize, bestowed by the Swedish Academy and known as the &#x201c;Little Nobel.&#x201d; Her books include the masterpiece <em>it</em>; <em>alphabet</em>; <em>Butterfly Valley;</em> and <em>Light, Grass, and Letter in April.</em></p><p><strong>Susanna Nied</strong>'s work has appeared in various literary journals and anthologies. Her translation of It won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award in 2007.</p><p><strong>Anne Carson</strong> was born in Canada and teaches ancient Greek for a living.</p>Christensen's sprawling, cosmically ambitious, book-length poem became a national hit in Denmark soon after its 1969 publication, and it's not hard to see why. The segments' diverse shapes&#x2014;prose litany, chiming quatrains, stuttering free verse, telegram, prose diary&#x2014;show mastery enough for almost any taste, while the overarching ideology&#x2014;liberation for the whole human person from institutions, laws, mere forms&#x2014;perfectly fit the late '60s' radical mood. Christensen begins by describing the creation of the whole world, narrows her focus to modern Danish society, then imagines recreating it, first in lyrical fragments ("A happy machine/ A wild imagination/ A fantastic din") and then through extended parables in which patients from an insane asylum learn to love one another and orchestrate social protests involving mass nudity. Drawing on Nietzsche, quoting Blake and Novalis, Christensen promises "crowns of gold for the holy/ fables for the freedom of matter," and argues that "the completely unreasonable activity is in reality reasonable, because it ends in a vision." Nied (who also translated Christensen's <i>Alphabet</i>) duplicates the Danish poem's mathematical schemes while also conveying its freshness and sense of freedom. Poet and classicist Anne Carson contributes a helpful introduction. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As recently as a century ago, the lake's shores stood four miles across and six miles long. During yearly high water, the lake spilled onto the surrounding prairies; during high flood years, it reached from Chilliwack into Washington State. Then, through the 1920s, a network of dykes, canals, dams and pumphouses was erected and the lake drained&#x2015;"reclaimed" in the words of projects supporters. A new landscape was created, a seemingly 'natural' prairie carved up into productive farmland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today, few people are aware that Sumas Lake ever existed. The only reminder is a plaque erected on the old lakeshore, at a rest-stop along the Trans-Canada Highway just east of Whatcom Road, on the historic trail blazed to BC's gold fields. Yet for millenniums, Sumas Lake was a dynamic, integral part of the region&#x2019;s natural and human landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>In his new book,&nbsp;<i>Before We Lost the Lake</i>, Chad Reimer sets out to truly reclaim Sumas Lake, to restore it to its proper place in the history of the Fraser Valley, BC and the Northwest Coast. Drawing on extensive primary material, Reimer reconstructs the life history of Sumas Lake from the glacial age through the lake&#x2019;s demise and after.&nbsp;<i>Before We Lost the Lake&nbsp;</i>examines the lake's natural history and ecology, its occupation and use by the Sema:th and other First Nations, its colonization by White immigrants, the environmental changes brought about by introduced plants and animals, and the campaign to drain it. Drainage proponents had their way and gradually the promised benefits were realized. But these benefits came at a heavy cost to the environment and for the Sema:th, whose traditional way of life was irretrievably lost.&nbsp;</p><p></p></p><p><p>Chad Reimer has a BA Honours in History from the University of British Columbia and an MA and PhD in History from York University. He wrote <i>Chilliwack's Chinatowns </i>for the Chinese Canadian Historical Society of BC and <i>Writing British Columbia History </i>with UBC Press. Reimer has also been published in <i>BC History </i>and <i>Pacific Northwest Quarterly</i>. He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he spent his first fourteen winters before moving to the gentler climate of Abbotsford, BC, teaching for some years at the University of Fraser Valley.</p>&#x201c;In this well researched and clearly written book, Reimer gives the reader a glimpse of little known B.C. history. It is a tale of colonial incursion and violence, appropriation and exploitation, racism and environmental heedlessness. At a time when there is much talk of reconciliation, it is important to have more information about the crimes of colonialism. We cannot fix what we do not see. Reimer has done us all a favour with this well crafted history.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>Tom Sandborn</b>, The&nbsp;<i>Vancouver Sun</i><br><br>&#x201c;A compelling cautionary tale of White newcomers&#x2019; determination to improve on nature at Indigenous Peoples&#x2019; expense.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>Jean Barman</b>, Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and author of&nbsp;<i>The West Beyond the West:</i><i>&nbsp;A H</i><i>istory of British Columbia</i><br><br><p>&#x201c;A terrific read, a nuanced book of careful scholarship,&nbsp;<i>Before We Lost</i>&nbsp;<i>the Lake</i>&nbsp;is sure to find a place on my reference bookshelf.

His eloquent and pointed work recalls the many meanings of this place over time through the memories of Sem:ath, Nooksack and Sto:lo elders, the field notes of Royal Engineers, the property records and voices of settlers, and modern sources.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>K.

Hyde of Omaha concerning life at the fort, his experiences with his Cheyenne kinsmen, and the events which finally led to the military suppression of the Indians on the southern Great Plains. This correspondence, which continued to the eve of Bent's death in 1918, is the source of the narrative here published, the narrator being Bent himself.</p><p>Almost ninety years have elapsed since the day in 1930 when Mr. Hyde found it impossible to market the finished manuscript of the Bent life down to 1866. (The Depression had set in some months before.) He accordingly sold that portion of the manuscript to the Denver Public Library, retaining his working copy, which carries down to 1875. The account therefore embraces the most stirring period, not only of Bent's own life, but of life on the Plains and into the Rockies. It has never before been published.</p><p>It is not often that an eyewitness of great events in the West tells his own story. But Bent's narrative, aside from the extent of its chronology (1826 to 1875), has very special significance as an inside view of Cheyenne life and action after the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864, which cost so many of the lives of Bent's friends and relatives. It is hardly probable that we shall achieve a more authentic view of what happened, as the Cheyennes, Arapahos, and Sioux saw it.</p></p><p><p><strong>George E. Hyde</strong><strong> </strong>was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1882. As a boy he became interested in Indians and began writing about them in 1910. He has produced some of the most important books on the American Indian ever written, including <em>Indians of the High Plains, Indians of the Woodlands, Red Cloud's Folk, Spotted Tail's Folk, </em>and <em>Life of George Bent, </em>all published by the University of Oklahoma Press. Hyde died in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1968 at the age of 86.</p><br><br><p><b>Savoie Lottinville</b>, editor of four series of books published by the University of Oklahoma Press during his tenure as director from 1938 to 1967, was Regents Professor of History in the University and Director Emeritus of the Press.

But in 2016, this decision was tested when the reliably blue, working-class county swung for Donald Trump. Virji watched in horror as his children faced anti-Muslim remarks at school and some of his most loyal patients began questioning whether he belonged in the community. <br><br>Virji wanted out. But in 2017, just as he was lining up a job in Dubai, a local pastor invited him to speak at her church and address misconceptions about what Muslims practice and believe. That invitation has grown into a well-attended lecture series that has changed hearts and minds across the state, while giving Virji a new vocation that he never would have expected. <br><br>In <i>Love Thy Neighbor</i>, Virji relates this story in a gripping, unforgettable narrative that shows the human consequences of our toxic politics, the power of faith and personal conviction, and the potential for a renewal of understanding in America's heartland.</p><p>AYAZ VIRJI<b> </b>is a family physician practicing in Dawson, Minnesota.

I&#x2019;ll be graduating in May of this year with my master&#x2019;s of divinity degree and then going on towards ordination in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.&#x201d;<br><br>Translation:<br> <i><br>I am a Christian.</i><br><br>Her credentials. Her passport. And in the town of Dawson&#x2014;a rural community of fifteen hundred souls that nonetheless manages to keep five churches running&#x2014;street cred. For a split second, I remember the night Mandy sat at our dining room table, telling a story that caused my wife, Musarrat, and me to laugh out loud. Some people from another church in town saw a yoga mat in Mandy&#x2019;s office and accused her of doing Islamic prayers in secret.<br><br>&#x201c;As you all know, the rhetoric right now in our world surrounding the Muslim community is not the greatest,&#x201d; Mandy says. &#x201c;It is hurtful, and the way the media has portrayed this community is harmful and it is wrong. That rhetoric has led to a lot of fear, something that is known as Islamophobia. For my internship project I decided to examine what it means to truly follow Jesus Christ&#x2019;s command to love thy neighbor.&#x201d; <br><br>Mandy turns to Musarrat and me and beams a conta- gious smile. My smile widens, mirroring hers.<br><br>She swivels away, looks straight ahead. Her forehead creases, and I catch a sudden look of determination.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew Dr. Virji from the clinic and had visited him a few times, actually as my doctor. I knew his family was the only Muslim family living in this community, and I approached them and asked if they would share with me and the community about their faith.&#x201d;<br> She leans forward and speaks with insistence.<br><br>&#x201c;They easily&#x2014;<i>easily</i>&#x2014;could have said no, but they graciously said yes and invited me into their home with- out hesitation. They both work full-time jobs. They have three amazing children and took time out of their sched- ules to sit with me and educate me and answer my questions about their faith and talk about their experience being Muslim in America post 9/11.&#x201d;<br><br> Mandy shakes her head slightly. &#x201c;These are people who are full of such grace, such dignity, and such acceptance of all people. To know this family is to know peace, and I can tell you that as a Christian person, I have learned more from them about what it means to follow the command &#x2018;Love thy neighbor&#x2019; than I have from many Christians I have encountered in my life. I am honored to call them my friends and to call them my neighbors as well.&#x201d;<br><br> She takes a small step back to allow the words to sink&nbsp;in.<br><br> &#x201c;Tonight, at this forum, we will have the opportunity at the end to engage in an open question and answer session. It is encouraged that you ask Dr. Virji those tough&nbsp;questions you have about the Islamic faith, the questions that you have about how the media portrays this faith, the questions you have wrestled with, the questions you might not otherwise ask. This is your chance to hear the truth from somebody who actually practices the faith.&#x201d; <br><br>I glance down at the outline I will use to deliver my speech, the eleven typed pages crinkling in my hands.<br><br> <i>Ask Dr. Virji those tough questions.<br></i><br> <i>Questions you have wrestled with. Questions you might not otherwise ask.<br></i><br>Three years ago, when we moved to Dawson, and up until the election of Donald Trump, Musarrat and I never knew that our neighbors even&nbsp;<i>had&nbsp;</i>tough questions about us, questions they might be afraid to ask. We felt only acceptance and welcome. Since then I&#x2019;ve wondered if those questions always existed and the election only brought them to the forefront.<br><br>I remember the first time we visited Dawson. We walked through the hospital where I would serve as chief of staff and head of the medical clinic. We toured the school our kids would attend. We strolled down the quaint main street, taking in the post office, barber shop, Wanda&#x2019;s Diner, the two-lane bowling alley, pharmacy, grocery store, the well-appointed library. Behind the main street, we saw an incongruous cluster of Victorian homes and approached the town park, where a quirky arrangement of garden gnome statues greeted us: Dawson&#x2019;s claim to fame, at least locally. Finally, most memorable of all, we met several warm, welcoming, down-to-earth people. Musarrat and I felt that we had found&nbsp;<i>home</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a fairy tale,&#x201d; Musarrat, who wears a hijab,&nbsp;said. &#x201c;No one stared at me.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>But after Trump carried the county with close to 65 percent of the vote and Mandy begin hearing from church members that people had questions&#x2014;and concerns&#x2014;about us, Musarrat said, &#x201c;I knew there was something underlying. It was too good to be true.&#x201d;<br><br>I love Dawson. I love the small-town manners, the intimacy, the proximity of everything. I often walk to work, a welcome change from sitting in traffic on the way to every other job I&#x2019;ve had. Our neighbors look out for us, drop in to say hi, shovel our sidewalk in the winter. We never lock our doors. We wouldn&#x2019;t think of it.<br><br>Dawson, too, was the place where my career became my calling. I left a high-end medical center in a midsize city because it practiced &#x201c;turnstile medicine&#x201d;:&nbsp;<i>Move them in and out as fast you can.&nbsp;</i>My position paid well, but that didn&#x2019;t matter. I felt frustrated and unfulfilled. In fact, I felt worse than that. I felt as if I weren&#x2019;t doing what I had been trained to do, what I was&nbsp;<i>supposed&nbsp;</i>to do: provide attentive and complete medical care to people who would become my patients and stay my patients for a long period of time, maybe even their entire lives. Because I was on a clock, forced to attend to a certain number of patients per day, I found myself focusing only on Mr. Smith&#x2019;s chest pain and not on Mr. Smith. In order to practice what I call &#x201c;dignified medicine,&#x201d; I would have to move.<br><br>Rural America was&#x2014;and is&#x2014;experiencing a severe doctor shortage. The latest statistics reveal a ratio of one doctor to 256 patients in cities compared with one doctor per 1,900 patients in rural America. So I convinced Musarrat to leave urban Pennsylvania, where we lived close&nbsp;to her family, and relocate to tiny Dawson, Minnesota, in farm country, at the far western tip of the state. As with any move, we experienced a period of adjustment and culture shock&#x2014;we were the only Muslims in town&#x2014;but by the end of the first year, we&#x2019;d settled in. The kids found their stride in their new school. I hit the ground running at the hospital, adding six new service lines, upgrading the equipment, and helping oversee a multimillion-dollar hospital remodel and expansion. Musarrat opened what would soon become an in-demand skin care salon in the center of town. Clients came to her from all over, some from neighboring towns and others from as far as Minneapolis, three hours away.&nbsp;<br><br>Then&#x2014;three years later&#x2014;came the 2016 presidential election.<br><br>Reality hit us abruptly, harshly.<br><br>Our government turned cold, referring to Islam as a cancer and suggesting that Muslims be put on a registry.<br><br>Anti-Muslim sentiment and hate speech blew across&nbsp;the country like a wildfire.<br><br>Even in Dawson. Our family&#x2019;s home.<br><br>The day after the election I exploded with anger. I&nbsp;wanted to leave. To flee. To escape.<br><br>Then&#x2014;soul-searching.<br><br>A calming. A call for justice. For explanation. For&nbsp;<i>truth</i>. Resulting in this talk.<br><br>This necessary talk.<br><br>Mandy booked the Dawson-Boyd High School auditorium and put up flyers around town, announcing tonight&#x2019;s event. She used innocuous language, calling the talk simply &#x201c;Love Thy Neighbor.&#x201d; The flyers explained that I&nbsp;would be speaking about my faith, about Islam.<br>&nbsp;<br>Almost immediately, the phone calls started coming.</p><h2>The Liberal Virus: Permanent War and the Americanization of the World</h2><p><p>Samir Amin's ambitious new book argues that the ongoing American project to dominate the world through military force has its roots in European liberalism, but has developed certain features of liberal ideology in a new and uniquely dangerous way. Where European political culture since the French Revolution has given a central place to values of equality, the American state has developed to serve the interests of capital alone, and is now exporting this model throughout the world. American imperialism, Amin argues, will be far more barbaric than earlier forms of imperialism, pillaging natural resources and destroying the lives of the poor.</p><p><b>The Liberal Virus</b> examines the ways in which the American model is being imposed on the world, and outlines its economic and political consequences. It shows how both citizenship and class consciousness are diluted in "low-intensity democracy" and argues instead for democratization as an ongoing process&#x2014;of fundamental importance for human progress&#x2014;rather than a fixed constitutional formula designed to support the logic of capital accumulation.</p><p>In a panoramic overview, Amin examines the objectives and outcomes of American policy in the different regions of the world. He concludes by outlining the challenges faced by those resisting the American project today: redefining European liberalism on the basis of a new compromise between capital and labor, re-establishing solidarity among the people of the South, and reconstructing an internationalism that serves the interests of regions that are currently divided against each other.</p></p><p><p><strong></strong><strong></strong> </p><p><strong>Samir Amin</strong> is Director of the Third World Forum in Dakar, Senegal and President of the World Forum for Alternatives. His numerous works include <em>Eurocentrism: Second Edition</em>, <em>The World We Wish to See</em>, <em>The Liberal Virus</em>, <em>Unequal Development</em>, and <em>Spectres of Capitalism</em>.</p>&#34;Amin is both a real-world social scientist and a revolutionary socialist.&#34; Review of Radical Political Economy</p><h2>True Sex: The Lives of Trans Men at the Turn of the Twentieth Century</h2><p><p><i><b>Winner, 2018 U.S. History PROSE Award</b></i><br><br><b>The incredible stories of how trans men assimilated into mainstream communities in the late 1800s</b><br><br>In 1883, Frank Dubois gained national attention for his life in Waupun, Wisconsin. There he was known as a hard-working man, married to a young woman named Gertrude Fuller. What drew national attention to his seemingly unremarkable life was that he was revealed to be anatomically female. Dubois fit so well within the small community that the townspeople only discovered his &#x201c;true sex&#x201d; when his former husband and their two children arrived in the town searching in desperation for their departed wife and mother.<br><br>At the turn of the twentieth century, trans men were not necessarily urban rebels seeking to overturn stifling gender roles. In fact, they often sought to pass as conventional men, choosing to live in small towns where they led ordinary lives, aligning themselves with the expectations of their communities. They were, in a word, unexceptional. <br><br>In <i>True Sex</i>, Emily Skidmore uncovers the stories of eighteen trans men who lived in the United States between 1876 and 1936. Despite their &#x201c;unexceptional&#x201d; quality, their lives are surprising and moving, challenging much of what we think we know about queer history. By tracing the narratives surrounding the moments of &#x201c;discovery&#x201d; in these communities &#x2013; from reports in local newspapers to medical journals and beyond &#x2013; this book challenges the assumption that the full story of modern American sexuality is told by cosmopolitan radicals. Rather, True Sex reveals complex narratives concerning rural geography and community, persecution and tolerance, and how these factors intersect with the history of race, identity and sexuality in America.</p></p><p><b>Emily Skidmore</b> is Associate Professor of History at Texas Tech University, specializing in the history of gender and sexuality in the United States. She lives in Lubbock, Texas."The personal accounts are presented in compelling detail and with compassion, living up to the promise of intimacy suggested by the cover photo of trans man Kenneth Lisonbee and his wife Stella Harper from the unlikely year of 1929." (<i>The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review</i>)<br><br>"Skidmore offers a three-fold critique. First, she provides well-drawn and sympathetic profiles of the compelling trans men considered; second, she offers a critical assessment of the press of the day and how it helped foster a new morality . . .and third, she engages in an ongoing critique of her field of study, LGBT scholarship." (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>"In <i>True Sex: The Lives of Trans Men at the Turn of the 20th Century</i>, Emily Skidmore describes how manhood in that day was as much a moral status as a sexual category. . .an especially intriguing . . . analysis." (<i>Inside Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"Tracking revelations of true sex in the decades around the turn of the twentieth-century U.S., Emily Skidmore recovers a history full of surprises: one in which people assigned female at birth lived ordinary lives as men, often in small towns and rural outposts. Newspaper revelations about trans men, Skidmore proposes, invited debate about queer embodiment and the porous boundaries of the gender binary. <i>True Sex</i> contains provocations and insights for queer history, for trans history, and for American history."<br><br>"<i>True Sex</i> is an important addition to queer and gender history and an insightful study of trans men that . . . challenge[s] several prevailing gender and queer theories. This brilliantly written and meticulously researched book should be part of all university gender curriculums." (<i>The Washington Bookreview</i>)<br><br>"Emily Skidmore's True Sex is an important addition to the literature on transgender history, offering a fresh approach to studying the subject and a wealth of new information that will help to broaden our understanding of sex and gender roles." (<i>Popmatters</i>)<br><br>"<i>True Sex</i> is a truly phenomenal book. Expansive in scope and implication, Emily Skidmores meticulously researched study of gender non-conformity in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century United States is all the more impressive for its dogged insistence that local entanglements often mattered more than expert opinion where Americans shifting beliefs about gender and sexual difference were concerned. A major contribution to the study of rural and small-town Americas little explored queer history, and an equally significant contribution to our understanding of rural and small-town Americas crucially important place in the history of queer life in the United States."<br><br>"The best sort of history surprising and delightful. Emily Skidmores <i>True Sex</i> reveals ordinary American communities at the turn of the twentieth century to have been much queerer than commonly imagined. By reconstructing the lives of trans men whose stories appeared in newspapers between 1870 and 1930, Skidmore makes a major contribution to our knowledge of queer history."<br><br>"Afascinating, humanizing look into the lives of trans men at the turn of the 20th century."

Langston Braverman returns to Haddington, Indiana (pop. 3,062) after walking out on an academic career that has equipped her for little but lording it over other people. Amos Townsend is trying to minister to a congregation that would prefer simple affirmations to his esoteric brand of theology.<br><br>What draws these difficult&#x2014;if not impossible&#x2014;people together are two wounded little girls who call themselves Immaculata and Epiphany. They are the daughters of Langston&#x2019;s childhood friend and the witnesses to her murder. And their need for love is so urgent that neither Langston nor Amos can resist it, though they do their best to resist each other.

With the opening of the Great Exhibition at hand, interest is mounting in the engineering triumphs of the railways, but not everyone feels like celebrating... In an audacious attack, the London to Birmingham mail train is robbed and derailed, causing many casualties. Planned with military precision, this crime proves a challenge to Detective Inspector Robert Colbeck who fights to untangle a web of murder, blackmail and destruction. As Colbeck closes in on the criminal masterminds, events take an unexpected turn when the beautiful Madeleine, daughter of the injured train driver, becomes a pawn in the criminals&#x2019; game. With time running out, good and evil, new and old, battle against each other. But will the long arm of the law have speed on its side? The Railway Detective is an action-packed dip into murky 1850s London. Full of historical detail, unexpected twists and memorable characters, this is a mystery that will surprise you at every turn.</p><p>Edward Marston has written over a hundred books, including some non fiction. He is best known for his hugely successful Railway Detective series. His other current series are the Home Front Detective , set in the Great War, and the Bow Street Rivals, featuring identical twin detectives during the Regency.The prolific Marston (the Domesday Books series, etc.) starts yet another historical mystery series with this middling police procedural that starts well but runs out of steam. Robert Colbeck, a former attorney now serving as an inspector in the fledging Scotland Yard of 1851, investigates a daring daylight train robbery that results in the derailment of the train and the theft of gold and mail. Later, those initially suspected of having provided the inside information that enabled the scheme's startling and speedy success turn up dead, while someone begins to blackmail members of the upper-class with the stolen letters. The spirited byplay among Colbeck, his rule-bound superintendent and his sergeant recalls Peter Lovesey's superlative Sergeant Cribb novels. But while Colbeck is a bright, unconventional and imaginative sleuth, Marston's choice to unmask the crimes' prime movers halfway through and to reduce an engaging female character, the daughter of the train's driver, into a stereotypical damsel in distress ultimately disappoints. One hopes Colbeck's next exploit will offer a more suspenseful, sophisticated plot. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nobody was standing over him, nobody was watching him, nobody was telling him where to go and when. He could have walked anywhere in that moment. Pick any direction and go. But the black Escalade was waiting for&nbsp;him, and as soon as he took those thirty steps and opened the passenger&#x2019;s side door, his freedom&nbsp;was gone again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mason had effectively signed a contract. When most men do that, they know what&#x2019;s expected of them. They get to read the terms, understand what the job&#x2019;s going to be, know exactly what they&#x2019;ll be expected to do. But Mason didn&#x2019;t get to read anything, because this contract wasn&#x2019;t on paper at all, and instead of actually signing anything, he simply gave his word, with no idea what would come next.<br><br> It was late afternoon, the heart of the day spent on processing and change-out. The daily&nbsp;discharge from USP Terre Haute. Typical prison operations, hurry up and wait, the screws dragging their feet all the way to the end. There were two other inmates with him, both anxious to get outside. One of the men he&#x2019;d never seen before. Not unusual in a prison with so many separate units. The second man was vaguely familiar. Someone from his original unit, before he made his move.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting out today,&#x201d; that man said, looking surprised. You don&#x2019;t talk about the length of your sentence with most men in this place, but there&#x2019;s no need to keep it a big secret, either. This man had obviously figured Mason for a long-timer. Or maybe he&#x2019;d heard it from someone else. Mason didn&#x2019;t care. He shrugged the man off without another word and went back to his final release forms.<br><br> When Mason was done with those, the clerk slid a plastic tray across the counter with the clothes he&#x2019;d been wearing the day he processed in. It felt like a lifetime ago. He&#x2019;d arrived here in this same room and been told to put his clothes in the tray. The black jeans and the white button- down shirt. Now, it felt strange to be taking off the khaki, like the color was a part of him. But<br> the old clothes still fit.<br> &nbsp;<br> All three men walked out together. The concrete walls, the steel doors, the two rows of chain-link fence topped with razor wire &#x2013; all left behind as they stepped out onto the hot pavement and waited for the gate to grind open. There were two families waiting there. Two wives, five kids, all of them looking like they&#x2019;d been standing there for hours. The kids held handmade signs with multicolored letters, welcoming their fathers home.<br><br> There was no family waiting for Nick Mason. No signs.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stood there blinking for a few seconds, feeling the hot Indiana sun on the back of his neck. He was clean shaven and fair-skinned, a little over six feet tall. His body was taut with&nbsp;muscle, but lean like a middleweight. An old scar ran the length of his right eyebrow. <br><br>He saw the black Escalade, idling near the sidewalk. The vehicle didn&#x2019;t move, so he&nbsp;walked down to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The windows were tinted. He couldn&#x2019;t see who was inside until he opened the front passenger&#x2019;s side door. Once he did, he saw that the driver was Hispanic, with dark sunglasses covering his eyes. One arm draped over the steering wheel, the other at rest on the gear shift. He wore a simple white T-shirt with the sleeves cut off, jeans and work boots, one thin gold chain around his neck. Dark hair pulled back and tied with a black band, and as Mason&#x2019;s eyes adjusted, he saw the gray threaded through the man&#x2019;s hair and the lines on the man&#x2019;s face. He was at least ten years older than Mason, maybe a few more. But he was rock solid. His arms were tattooed all the way down both arms to his fingers, and he had three rings in his right ear. Mason couldn&#x2019;t&nbsp;see the other, because the man did not turn to him. <br><br>&#x201c;Mason,&#x201d; the man said. A statement, not a question. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Mason said.<br><br> &#x201c;Get in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Out five minutes, Mason said to himself, and I&#x2019;m already about to break my rules. &nbsp;Rule Number One: <i>Never work with strangers. Strangers put you in prison or they put you in the ground. </i>A stranger already put me in the first. I don&#x2019;t need another stranger to put me in the other.<br><br> Today, Mason didn&#x2019;t have a choice. He got in and closed the door. The man still hadn&#x2019;t turned to face him. He put the vehicle in gear and accelerated smoothly out of the prison parking lot.<br> Mason scanned the vehicle. The interior was clean. The leather seats, the carpet, the&nbsp;windows. He had to give the man credit for that much. The vehicle looked like it had just rolled out of the showroom.<br>&nbsp; <br>He gave the man&#x2019;s tattoos another look. No prison ink here. No spider webs. No clocks without hands. This man had spent a lot of time and money in the chair of a real pro, even if some of the color had faded over time. There was an Aztec lattice going all the way up the right arm, with a snake, a jaguar, a headstone, and some Spanish words meaning God knows what. What was unmistakable were the three letters in green, white, and red on the shoulder. LRZ. <i>La Raza</i>. The Mexican gang that ruled the West Side of Chicago.<br><br> Another rule broken, Nick thought. Rule Number Nine: <i>Never work with gang members.&nbsp;</i>They&#x2019;ve sworn a blood oath of loyalty. But not to you.<br> &nbsp;<br> An hour of silence passed. The driver hadn&#x2019;t offered so much as a sideways glance. Mason couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what would happen if he turned on the radio. Or actually said something out loud. Something made him stay silent. Rule Number Three: <i>When in doubt, keep your mouth shut</i>.<br><br> After driving past every exit on US-41, they finally pulled off. For an instant, Mason wondered if this whole thing had been a setup. It was an unavoidable prison reflex, to be ready for the worst at any moment. Two hours away from the prison, somewhere in the middle of western Indiana, the driver could pull off on the most abandoned exit he could find, drive a few miles into the farmland and then put a bullet in the passenger&#x2019;s head. Leave his body right there in the ditch beside the road. You wouldn&#x2019;t go to that much trouble to do something that could have been done already, on any given day standing around the prison yard, but Mason could still feel his body tensing as the vehicle slowed down.<br><br> The driver pulled into a gas station. He got out and pumped gas into the tank. Mason sat&nbsp;there in the passenger&#x2019;s seat, looking out at the little minimart. A young woman came out through the glass door. Maybe twenty years old. Shorts and a tank top, flip flops on her feet. Mason hadn&#x2019;t seen a live woman dressed this way in five years.<br>&nbsp; <br>The driver got back in and started the vehicle. He pulled out and drove back onto the highway, pointed north and hit seventy on the speedometer. Dark clouds began to assemble in the sky. By the time they reached the Illinois border, it was raining. The driver turned on the wipers. The traffic got heavier and the lights from the other cars were reflected on the rain- slicked road.<br><br> The tall buildings were lost in the clouds, but Mason would have known this place, no matter how dark the sky or how low the clouds hung over the city streets.<br><br> He was almost home.<br> &nbsp;<br> But first the long pass over the Calumet River, the cranes and drawbridges and power lines. The harbor was down there. The harbor and the one night in his life when everything changed. The one night that led him all the way to Terre Haute and to a man named Cole. Then somehow all the way back, a lot sooner than he expected.<br><br> He counted down the streets. Eighty-seventh Street. Seventy-first Street. They were on the South Side now. The rain kept falling. The driver kept driving. Garfield Avenue. Fifty-first Street. You want to start an argument, you go into any bar around here, ask the regulars if Canaryville starts at Fifty-first or Forty-ninth. Stand back and watch the words fly. Then the fists if it&#x2019;s late enough.<br><br> They passed the big train yard, a thousand boxcars waiting for an engine. Then the tracks running high along the eastern edge of his old neighborhood. Mason took a breath as they passed Forty-third Street. His whole life came back to him at once in a sudden flood of almost random&nbsp;memories, both good and bad &#x2013; Eddie&#x2019;s dad taking them to old Comiskey Park, the first car he ever stole, the only game he ever got to see Michael Jordan play in person, the first time Mason spent the night in jail, the party where he met a Canaryville girl named Gina Sullivan, the day he bought their house, the only place he could ever call home... it was all right here, wrapped up together in the city of Chicago. The alleys and the streets of this place ran through him like the veins in his body.<br>&nbsp; <br>The lights were on at the new Sox park, but it was still raining too hard to play. The Escalade went all the way downtown, crossing the Chicago River. The Sears Tower &#x2013; always and forever the Sears Tower, despite whatever new name they try to give it &#x2013; dominated the skyline and looked down at them through a sudden break in the clouds, its two antennae like a devil&#x2019;s horns.<br><br> The driver finally got off the highway and took North Avenue all the way across the North Side, until Mason could see the shores of Lake Michigan. The water stretched out in blues and grays forever, blending into the rainclouds. When they turned on Clark Street, Mason was about to say something. You bring me all the way up to the North Side for what, pal? A Cubs game, maybe? Good luck with that one.<br><br> Mason hated the Cubs. He hated everything about the North Side. Everything it represented. When he was growing up, the North Side was everything he didn&#x2019;t have, and never would have.<br><br> The driver made his last turn, onto the last street Mason thought he&#x2019;d see that day. Lincoln Park West. It was four blocks of high-end apartment buildings overlooking the gardens and the conservatory and the lake beyond. There were a few townhouses between the apartment buildings, still tall enough to look down at the street and on everyone who passed by. The driver <br>slowed down and stopped right in front of one of those townhouses. It sat at the end of the block, rising three stories above the heavy front door and the garage bays, the upper-floor windows all covered with iron latticework. Built out to the side was another one story with a balcony on top, overlooking the cross street, the park, and the lake beyond it. Five million for this place? Hell, probably more.<br><br> The driver broke the silence. &#x201c;My name is Quintero.&#x201d; He made the name sound like it came from the bottom of a tequila bottle. <i>KeenTAYro</i>.<br><br> &#x201c;You work for Cole?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen to me,&#x201d; Quintero said. &#x201c;Because everything I&#x2019;m about to say is important.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mason looked over at him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You need something,&#x201d; Quintero said, &#x201c;you call me. You get in a situation, you call me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t get creative. Don&#x2019;t try to fix anything yourself. <i>You call me</i>. Clear so far?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mason nodded.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Beyond that, I don&#x2019;t give a fuck what you do with your time. You were inside for five years so go have a drink, get yourself laid, I don&#x2019;t care. Just understand, you need to stay out of trouble. You get picked up for <i>anything</i>, now you&#x2019;ve got two problems. The one you got picked up for... and me.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason turned and looked out the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why are we here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is where you live now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Guys like me don&#x2019;t live in Lincoln Park,&#x201d; Mason said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give you a cell phone. You&#x2019;re going to answer this phone when I call you. Whenever that may be. Day or night. There is no busy. There is no unavailable. There is only&nbsp;you answering this phone. Then doing <i>exactly </i>what I tell you to do.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br> Mason sat there in his seat, thinking that one over.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The phone is in here,&#x201d; Quintero said, reaching behind the seat and bringing out a large&nbsp;envelope. &#x201c;Along with the keys to the front and back doors, and the security code.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mason took the envelope. It was heavier than he expected.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ten thousand dollars in cash, and the key to a safe-deposit box at First Chicago on&nbsp;Western. There&#x2019;ll be ten thousand more on the first day of each month.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mason looked over at the man one more time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Quintero said. &#x201c;Keep your phone on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mason opened the passenger&#x2019;s side door. Before he could get out, Quintero grabbed his arm. Mason tensed up &#x2013; another prison reflex, someone grabs you, your first reaction is deciding which finger to break first.<br><br> &#x201c;One more thing,&#x201d; Quintero said, holding on tight. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t freedom. This is <i>mobility</i>.&nbsp;Don&#x2019;t get those two things confused.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Quintero let him go. Mason stepped out and closed the door. The rain had stopped.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mason stood there on the sidewalk and watched Quintero&#x2019;s vehicle pull away from the curb, then disappear into the night. He reached into the envelope and took out the key. Then he opened the front door and went inside.<br> &nbsp;<br>***<br> &nbsp;<br> The townhouse entranceway had a high ceiling and the light fixture hanging over Mason&#x2019;s head was a piece of modern art with a thousand slivers of glass. The floor was large tiles laid diagonally in a diamond pattern. The stairs were polished cherry. He stood there for a moment until he noticed a beeping noise. He saw the security panel on the wall, took out the&nbsp;code from the envelope and entered it on the keyboard. The beeping stopped. <br>&nbsp;<br> The door to his right opened to a two-car garage. In one space he saw a black Mustang. He knew exactly what this was. It was a 1968 390 GT Fastback, a jet-black version of the car Steve McQueen drove in <i>Bullitt</i>. He&#x2019;d never stolen a car like this, because you don&#x2019;t steal a masterpiece and take it to the chop shop. You don&#x2019;t steal a car like this and drive it yourself, no matter how much you want to. That&#x2019;s how amateurs get caught.<br><br> The other spot in the garage was empty. He saw the faint outline of tire tracks. Another car belonged here.<br><br> Mason opened another door and saw a full gym. A row of dumbbells neatly arranged in pairs ranged from nothing to the big fifty-pounders at the end. A bench with a rack, a treadmill, an elliptical trainer. A television was mounted high in one corner of the room. A heavy bag hung in another corner. The back wall was a full mirror. Mason looked at his own face from twenty feet away. Cole had told him he could go anywhere in the world with this face, but he never thought he&#x2019;d end up in a Lincoln Park townhouse.<br><br> He went up the long flight of stairs to what was obviously the main floor of the townhouse. The sleek, modern kitchen had polished granite countertops, an island with a Viking stove and a restaurant hood hanging over it. The bar top looked out over a great open area dominated by the largest television screen Mason had ever seen. He was pretty sure the square foota...</p><h2>The Lost Words</h2><p><p><b>Penguin presents the audiobook edition of <i>The Lost Words </i>by Robert Macfarlane. </b></p><p>All over the country, there are words disappearing from children's lives.

She bends an agile mind and sharp tongue around the daily tasks of seeing eye-to-navel with a world that clearly prefers nondisabled &#34;normals.&#34; One candid, pained essay tells of longing to give care, not just accept it. Others describe the shifting line in the sands marking limits she could live with; teeth-grinding frustration at foolish building practices that keep even public bathrooms out of her reach; and a discomforting adventure as an undercover agent exposing a drug fraud aimed at people with diseases like MS.In Waist-High in the World, Mairs explores in her inimitable voice the subject that has always been in the background of her writing, but which she takes on here for the first time at book-length - disability and the way it shapes a life. The result is a brave and beautiful book that will open new worlds for readers. It begins with a disavowal (&#34;I cannot begin to write this book....I don&#39;t want to think about my crippled life&#34;) and ends with a declaration of hope (&#34;I choose joy&#34;). In between, Mairs gives us a brilliant portrait of an issue and experience too rarely portrayed and talked about. She begins with subjects close to home: the personal history of her disease, the intimate realities of the body, the moral economy of care and caregiving, life with her husband and children. The second half of the book covers topics that look outward: women with disabilities, obstacles physical and social, the ethics of selective abortion and euthanasia, the joys and troubles of travel, and more.</p><h2>Killer Clothes</h2><p>How Seemingly Innocent Clothing Choices Endanger Your Health...and how to protect yourself! <br>This book reveals in unprecedented detail the toxic truth about the clothes we wear and the surprising number of harmful effects on our health caused by garments once considered safe. <p> Readers will learn what fabrics and chemicals to watch for when selecting clothing, why to avoid any garment that has anti-odor, antistatic, antimicrobial, etc., along with tips for ecological and health-friendly cleaning, and the advantages for choosing natural fabrics. </p><p>They'll also learn the many ways that synthetic clothing, chemicals added to garments, and tight clothing and tight shoes create dangerous problems for human health and the environment.

Visit her at SusanMallery.com.In a battle between Betty Boop and multicolored hearts, Nina Wentworth decided it was going to be a Betty Boop kind of day. She pulled the short-sleeved scrub shirt over her head and was already moving toward the bathroom before the fabric settled over her hips.<br><br>"Don't be snug, don't be snug," she chanted as she came to a stop in front of the mirror and reached for her brush.<br><br>The shirt settled as it should, with a couple of inches to spare. Nina breathed a sigh of relief. Last night's incident with three brownies and a rather large glass of red wine hadn't made a lasting impression on her hips. She was grateful, and she would repent later on an elliptical. Or at least vow to eat her brownies one at a time.<br><br>Ten seconds of brushing, one minute of braiding and her blond hair was neat and tidy. She dashed out into the hall, toward the kitchen where she grabbed her car keys and nearly made it to the back door. Just as she was reaching for the knob, the house phone rang.<br><br>Nina glanced from the clock to the phone. Everyone in her world&#x2014;friends, family, work&#x2014;had her cell. Very few calls came on the antiquated landline, and none of them were good news. Nina retraced her steps and braced herself for disaster. "Hello?"<br><br>"Hey, Nina. It's Jerry down at Too Good To Be True. I just opened, and there's a lady here trying to sell a box of crap, ah, stuff. I think it's from the store."<br><br>Nina closed her eyes as she held in a groan. "Let me guess. Early twenties, red hair with purple streaks and a tattoo of a weird bird on her neck?"<br><br>"That's her. She's glaring at me something fierce. You think she's armed?"<br><br>"I hope not."<br><br>"Me, too." Jerry didn't sound especially concerned. "What's her name?"<br><br>"Tanya."<br><br>If Nina had more time, she would have collapsed right there on the floor. But she had a real job to get to. A job unrelated to the disaster that was the family's antique store.<br><br>"You let your mom hire her, huh?" Jerry asked.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"You know better."<br><br>"That I do. I'll call the police and ask them to pick up Tanya. Can you keep her there until they get there?"<br><br>"Sure thing, kid."<br><br>"Great. And I'll be by after work to pick up the stuff."<br><br>"I'll hold it for you," Jerry promised.<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>Nina hung up and hurried to her car. After her cell connected to the Bluetooth, she called the local sheriff's department and explained what happened.<br><br>"Again?" Deputy Sam Payton asked, his voice thick with amusement. "Did you let your mom hire this employee?"<br><br>Nina carefully backed out of the driveway. Jerry's humor she could handle. He'd lived here all his life&#x2014;he was allowed to tease her. But Sam was relatively new. He hadn't earned mocking rights.<br><br>"Hey, tax-paying citizen here, reporting a crime," she said.<br><br>"Yeah, yeah. I'm writing it down. What'd she take?"<br><br>"I didn't ask. She's at the pawn shop. Too Good To Be True."<br><br>"I know it," Deputy Sam told her. "I'll head out and see what's what."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>She hung up before he could offer advice on hiring policies and turned up the hill. The morning was clear&#x2014;odd for early spring in the Pacific Northwest. Normally the good weather didn't kick in until closer to summer. To the west, blue water sparkled. To the east was western Washington.<br><br>As she climbed higher and higher, the view got better, but when she parked across from the three Queen Anne houses at the very top of the hill, pausing to enjoy the spectacular combination of sky and ocean was the last thing on her mind.<br><br>She hurried up the steps to the front porch that was both her boss's home and her office. Dr. Andi, as she was known, was a popular pediatrician on the island. Make that the <em>only</em> pediatrician. She'd moved here a year ago, opened her practice in September and had been thriving ever since. She was also a newlywed and, as of two months ago, pregnant.<br><br>Nina unlocked the front door and stepped inside. She flipped on lights as she went, confirmed the temperature on the thermostat and then started the three computers in the front office.<br><br>After storing her purse in her locker, she logged in to the scheduling program and saw that the first appointment of the day had canceled. Andi would appreciate the extra time to get herself moving. She was still battling morning sickness.<br><br>Nina did a quick check of her email, forwarded several items to the bookkeeper/office manager, then walked to the break room for coffee. Fewer than five minutes after she'd arrived, she was climbing the stairs to her boss's private quarters.<br><br>Nina knocked once before entering. She found Andi, a tall, pretty brunette with curly hair, sitting at the table in the kitchen. Her arms cradled her head.<br><br>"Still bad?" Nina asked, walking to the cupboard.<br><br>"Hi and yes. It's not that I throw up, it's that I feel like I'm going to every single second." She raised her head and drew in a breath. "Are you drinking coffee?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"I miss coffee. I'm a wreck. I need to talk to my parents about my ancestors. Obviously I don't come from hardy stock."<br><br>Nina took down a mug, filled it with water and put it in the microwave. Then she collected a tea bag from the pantry.<br><br>"Not ginger tea," Andi said with a moan. "Please. I hate it."<br><br>"But it helps."<br><br>"I'd rather feel sick."<br><br>Nina raised her eyebrows.<br><br>Andi slumped in her seat. "I'm such a failure. Look at me. I'm carrying around a child the size of a lima bean and I'm throwing a hissy fit. It's embarrassing."<br><br>"And yet the need to act mature doesn't seem to be kicking in."<br><br>Andi smiled. "Funny how that works."<br><br>The microwave dinged. Nina dropped the tea bag into the steaming water and crossed to the table.<br><br>The eat-in kitchen was open, with painted cabinets and lots of granite. The big window by the table took advantage of the east-facing views in the old house. The mainland shimmered only a few miles away.<br><br>Andi had bought the house&#x2014;one of three up on the hill&#x2014;when she'd moved to Blackberry Island. Undeterred by the broken windows and outdated plumbing, she'd had the house restored from the framework out. During the process, she'd fallen in love with her contractor. Which had led to her current tummy problems.<br><br>"Your first appointment canceled," Nina told her.<br><br>"Thank God." Andi sniffed the tea, then wrinkled her nose and took a sip. "It's the ginger. If I could have tea without ginger I think I could get it down."<br><br>"The thing is, the ginger is the part that settles your stomach."<br><br>"Life is perverse like that." Andi took another sip, then smiled. "I like the shirt."<br><br>Nina glanced down at the pattern. "Betty and I go way back."<br><br>One of the advantages of working for a pediatrician was that cheerful attire was encouraged. She had a collection of brightly colored fun shirts in her closet. It wasn't high fashion, but it helped the kids smile and that was what mattered.<br><br>"I need to get back downstairs," she said. "Your first appointment is now at eight-thirty."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>Nina rose and started toward the stairs.<br><br>"Are you busy after work?" Andi asked.<br><br>Nina thought about the fact that she was going to have to go by the pawn shop and pick up what Tanya had tried to sell, then spend several hours at Blackberry Preserves, her family's antique store, figuring out what had been stolen, then tell her mother what had happened and possibly lecture her on the importance of actually following up on a potential employee's references. Only she'd been lecturing her mother for as long as she could remember, and the lessons never seemed to stick. No matter how many times Bonnie promised to do better, she never did. Which left Nina picking up the pieces.<br><br>"I kind of am. Why?"<br><br>"I haven't been to Pilates in a week," Andi said. "It's important I keep exercising. Would you go with me? It's more fun when you're along."<br><br>"I can't tonight, but Monday's good."<br><br>Andi smiled. "Thanks, Nina. You're the best."<br><br>"Give me a plaque and I'll believe it."<br><br>"I'll order one today."<br><br>Nina counted out the number of happy fruit and vegetable stickers she had. Just enough, but she would have to order more.<br><br>Since opening her practice, Andi had started a program of inviting local elementary school classes into her office as a field trip. Kids learned about a basic exam, were able to use the stethoscope and check their weight and height in a nonthreatening atmosphere. Andi's goal was to make a visit to the doctor less stressful.<br><br>Nina handled the scheduling and conducted the tour. Each student left with a small goodie bag filled with the stickers, a small coloring book on different ways to exercise and a box of crayons.<br><br>Normally the gift bags were filled by their receptionist before the event, but she had forgotten the stickers last time, so Nina had taken over the task.<br><br>She was in the middle of lining up the open goodie bags for quick filling when her cell phone buzzed. She pulled it from her pocket and checked the name, then pushed speaker and set it on the break-room table.<br><br>"Hi, Mom."<br><br>"Sweetheart! How are you? We're fine, but you were right, as you usually are."<br><br>Nina grabbed crayons from the big bag of them on the chair. "Right about what?"<br><br>"The tires. That we should have replaced them before we left. We had snow last night."<br><br>Nina glanced out the window at the sunny skies. She could see a few clouds pilling up against the horizon. Rain later that afternoon, she thought.<br><br>"Where are you?"<br><br>"Montana. It was coming down like you wouldn't believe. We had about four inches, and the tires just couldn't handle it. We skidded off the road. We're fine now. Bertie found a Les Schwab store and the man there was just as nice as the one back home."<br><br>Nina sank onto the only free chair in the break room. "You were in a car accident?"<br><br>"No. We skidded. Not to worry. We're fine. The new tires are very nice. We went to several estate sales and more antique stores than I can count. We're filling the van with so many beautiful things. You're going to love what we've found."<br><br>She kept talking. Nina closed her eyes and rubbed her temples, telling herself that her commitment to eat her brownies one at a time had not made any reference to wine, and when she got home that night, she was taking a bath and having a glass. Then she'd have her breakdown.<br><br>Bonnie Wentworth had given birth to her oldest at sixteen. She hadn't settled down when she'd become a mother, and she sure wasn't settled now. Bonnie and her partner, Bertie, traveled the country on "buying trips" for their antique store. Antique being defined very loosely in this case. Junk was probably more accurate, but even Nina avoided the "j" word as much as possible.<br><br>She drew in a breath as her mother talked about a handmade doll Bertie had found.<br><br>"Mom, Tanya was caught trying to sell inventory to Jerry this morning."<br><br>Bonnie paused. "No," she said, sounding stunned. "I don't believe it."<br><br>Nina resisted the need to point out that Bonnie never believing it was the main problem.<br><br>"This is why I want to do the interviewing. Or, if not me, then at least let Bertie do it."<br><br>"Are you sure she wasn't selling something of her own?" Bonnie asked. "She seemed like such a nice girl. I hate to think of her doing something like that."<br><br>"Me, too. You know this means the store's closed." Again.<br><br>There was silence. "Do you want us to come back? We could be there in a couple of days."<br><br>"No. I'll find someone."<br><br>Nina knew that if she asked, her mother would come home and run the store while they found someone. But then Nina would feel guilty, like she did now. And for the life of her, she couldn't figure out why.<br><br>"Sweetheart, you take on too much."<br><br>Nina opened her mouth and closed it. Right. Mostly because no one else was here to do it. "Mom, it's fine. But we need someone in the store who's responsible and can work without stealing."<br><br>"You're right. There must be someone, and I'm sure you'll find her."<br><br>"I will. Did you call on the roof? Is the guy coming out to fix it?"<br><br>"I did call." Her mother sounded triumphant. "It's taken care of."<br><br>"Great. Thanks."<br><br>"You're welcome. I love you, sweetheart."<br><br>"I love you, too, Mom."<br><br>"I'll call in a few days. By then we should know when we'll be home. Bye."<br><br>Nina heard the click and knew her mother had hung up. Before she returned to the goodie bags, she called the local paper.<br><br>"Hi, Ellen, it's Nina Wentworth."<br><br>The old woman cackled. "Let me guess. You need someone to work at Blackberry Preserves. I have the information from the last ad, which is the same as the one before and the one before that. Want me to run it?"<br><br>Nina glanced out the window again. The storm clouds were closer. She could see a bit of the Sound and wondered if she got on a boat right now, where she would end up.<br><br>"That would be great," she said instead. "Thanks, Ellen."<br><br>"You know, Nina, you've got to stop letting your mama hire people for that store."<br><br>Nina tightened her grip on the phone. "Yes, I know."<br><br>Nina stared at the items in the box. The candlesticks were silver and actually worth something. There were also several pieces of jewelry, a few with gems. The painting was a cheap reproduction and worth less than the frame, but still...<br><br>Jerry nodded as she inventoried the haul. "I was thinking the same thing," he told her. "How could a girl smart enough to know what to steal be dumb enough to come to me? Why didn't she just drive over the bridge and head toward Seattle? Another forty minutes in the car and she could have had the cash and been on her way."<br><br>"That's exactly what I was thinking," she admitted. "But I'm glad she was impatient. Was Sam Payton by?"<br><br>"Yup. He took pictures. He said he needs to know what the candlesticks are worth." Jerry, a chubby, balding man in his sixties, nodded knowingly. "If it's over five grand, then Miss Tanya has committed a Class B felony. If she gets the maximum, it's a ten year prison sentence with a twenty thousand dollar fine."<br><br>"You're very knowledgeable about felonies and the law."<br><br>"In my business, it pays to know that sort of thing."<br><br>Nina picked up the box of items from the store. "I'm going to have to call Sam, aren't I? He's going to tell me I can't sell these until the case against Tanya is settled, right?"<br><br>"I wouldn't be surprised," Jerry told her.<br><br>Great. So the only items of value in the store were now going to be held hostage. She started for the door. "Thanks, Jerry."<br><br>"You're welcome. Hire better people."<br><br>"I'll do my best."<br><br>He buzzed the door so she could get out.<br><br>Nina crossed the small parking lot and opened her trunk. As she walked around to the driver's side, she felt the first drops of rain.<br><br>Although the house was only a few blocks away, she was going to have to go by the store and put up a sign explaining it would be closed for the next few days. She should also see what else might have been stolen. This may not have been Tanya's first attempt.

Use the sweetest, ripest cherry tomatoes you can find. Cut them in half, even though they're little, so their juices mingle with the corn and peppery arugula. This is a great make-ahead dish for a picnic or light supper. Serve it simply with toasted bread and goat cheese.</i></p><p><b>SERVES 4 TO 6</b></p><p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p><p>1 large shallot, diced, about 1/4 cup</p><p>Salt and pepper</p><p>4 ears corn, shaved, about 4 cups kernels</p><p>1/4 cup water</p><p>Champagne vinegar</p><p>1/2 pint ripe, little cherry tomatoes, cut in half</p><p>A large handful of arugula</p><p>Heat the oil in a large saut� pan and add the shallots, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Saut� over medium heat until the shallots begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the corn and saut� for 1 minute. Add the water, lower the heat, and cover the pan. Simmer until the corn is tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and season with 1 tablespoon of the vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Set aside to cool.</p><p>Toss in the cherry tomatoes and arugula just before serving and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and a splash of vinegar, if needed.</p><p><b>VARIATION:</b> Substitute leftover grilled or roasted peppers for the cherry tomatoes. Quickly dice the peppers and don't mind the little flecks of skin -- they add a rustic touch to the salad. In place of the shallot and arugula, use scallions and thinly sliced basil.</p><p>Copyright � 2003 by Annie Somerville</p><p><b>Dinosaur Kale with Toasted Almonds</b></p><p><i>This funny-looking kale goes by many names -- Tuscan kale, cavolo nero, lacinato, or, simply, dino kale. We call it dinosaur kale, with its thick center rib that runs straight like a spine down pebbly, dark green leaves. With a color and texture unlike any other, dinosaur kale is incomparable in hearty fall and winter soups and rago�ts. It's also delicious spooned over Warm White Beans or served alongside Roasted Winter Vegetable Lasagne.</i></p><p><i>Parboil the greens before you saut� them, so they're tender when you add them to the pan. This step softens their strong flavor and shortens the cooking time all around.</i></p><p><b>SERVES 4</b></p><p>1 or 2 bunches dinosaur kale, about 1/2 pound, stems and ribs discarded, leaves cut into thick strips, about 10 cups</p><p>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p><p>2 teaspoons minced garlic</p><p>Salt and pepper</p><p>1 or 2 tablespoons unskinned almonds, toasted (page 46) and chopped</p><p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt lightly. Drop in the kale, cook until tender, about 5 minutes, and drain.</p><p>Heat the oil in a large saut� pan and add the kale, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Saut� over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, adding a little water if needed to keep the kale from sticking to the pan. Toss in the almonds just before serving and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p><p>Copyright � 2003 by Annie Somerville</p><p><b>Linguine with Summer Beans, Gremolata, and Olives</b></p><p><i>The fresh taste of gremolata -- minced flat-leaf parsley, lemon zest, and garlic -- adds zip to this summer pasta, and green beans and yellow wax beans are especially beautiful. The cooking time varies with each variety, so be sure to cook them separately. You can use Kalamata or little Ni�oise olives instead of Gaeta as long as you don't use too many -- 1/3 cup pitted and coarsely chopped is all you'll need. Toss in the olives just before serving to keep the colors bright.</i></p><p><b>SERVES 4 TO 6</b></p><p>Gremolata (recipe follows)</p><p>3/4 pound summer beans, preferably Blue Lake, and yellow wax beans, stem ends trimmed, cut in half on the diagonal</p><p>3/4 pound fresh linguine</p><p>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p><p>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</p><p>Salt and pepper</p><p>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</p><p>20 Gaeta olives, pitted and coarsely chopped, about 1/3 cup (see headnote)</p><p>1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated, about 1/3 cup, plus more to serve at the table</p><p>Make the Gremolata and set aside.</p><p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt lightly. Drop in the beans, one variety at a time, and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes depending on their size. Scoop out the beans, rinse under cold water, and set aside to drain.</p><p>Drop the pasta into the water and cook until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes.</p><p>While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large saut� pan and add the beans, the garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Saut� over medium heat for 1 minute. Add 1 cup of the pasta cooking water to the pan, along with the lemon juice, the gremolata, the remaining oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Drain the pasta, add it to the pan, and cook for 1 minute, tossing it gently to coat with the gremolata and the sauce. Toss in the olives and the cheese at the last minute. Serve with freshly grated Parmesan.</p><p><b>Gremolata:</b> <i>This intense, fresh condiment adds a bright touch to our pastas and vegetable dishes. You can make it an hour or two in advance, but not much more or it will lose its freshness.</i></p><p>1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p><p>1 1/2 tablespoons minced lemon zest</p><p>3 garlic cloves, minced</p><p>Mix everything together in a small bowl.</p><p><b>TIP:</b> Have everything ready before you cook the pasta. You can use dried pasta instead and cook it ahead of time, if you like. Be sure to rinse it under cold water and toss it with a little olive oil to keep it from sticking together.</p><p>Copyright � 2003 by Annie Somerville</p><p><b>Asparagus Bread Pudding</b></p><p><i>We feature this delightful dish -- inspired by Georgeanne Brennan's recipe -- in late spring, when the local asparagus season is under way. Of course, you can use all kinds of vegetables and cheeses, depending on the time of year. Remember, the flavor and texture of the bread makes all the difference -- we use day-old ciabatta or sourdough Italian.</i></p><p><b>SERVES 6 TO 8</b></p><p>1 pound rustic bread, crust removed, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices</p><p>1 1/2 cups milk</p><p>1 cup heavy cream</p><p>6 large eggs</p><p>3/4 teaspoon salt</p><p>Pinch of pepper</p><p>1 pound asparagus, tough stem ends removed, cut into 2-inch pieces</p><p>1/4 pound Fontina cheese, grated, about 1 cup</p><p>3 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated, about 1 cup</p><p>1/4 cup chopped mixed herbs: thyme, oregano or marjoram, chives, and flat-leaf parsley</p><p>Place the bread in a large shallow dish and pour the milk over.

Drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside to drain.</p><p>Combine the cheeses in a small bowl. Place one-third of the soaked bread in the bottom of the souffl� or baking dish. Place half of the asparagus over, sprinkle with one-third of the cheese mixture, and half of the herbs. Layer half of the remaining bread over, cover with the rest of the asparagus, half of the remaining cheese, and the rest of the herbs. Cover with the last of the bread and the cheese. Pour the custard over the top. Bake until golden, about 1 hour.

This personal narrative is thoroughly documented and includes maps and scores of rare, old photographs.</p><p>Bud Moore grew up in the shadow of the Bitterroot mountains. He hunted, trapped, and explored the Lolo and Lochsa drainages--east and west of the Bitterroot crest--and knew all the stories local mountain men had to tell about that country by the time he took a job with the U.S. Forest Service in 1934.<br>During his forty-year career as a forester, he became even more knowledgeable and attached to the land. He is the principal architect of the Forest Service's current wilderness fire management policy, and is known as one of its "greatest fire experts," according to his good friend, the late Norman Maclean, who wrote <i>Young Men and Fire</i> and <i>A River Runs Through It</i>. In addition, Moore knows a great deal about other forestry issues such as water quality, sustainable use of resources, and the "wholeness" of the land now termed "ecosystem management."<br>Since retiring from the Forest Service in 1974, Moore has turned his attention to managing Coyote Forest, an 80-acre plot of land in Montana's Swan Valley, plus another 167 acres farther south, near the town of Ovando. The centerpiece of the operation is a sawmill that produces lumber from their "light-on-the-land" approach to logging in the Swan Valley. He uses an "even-flow" system--balancing the rate of harvest with the rate of forest regeneration and growth.<br>Moore is profoundly dedicated to the forest and all of the natural elements, including people, that make it whole. He believes anyone who works with the land must have a feel for it. "When in doubt, go slow," he advises. "Be humble. Learn from your mistakes."&#34;Bud Moore&#39;s The Lochsa Story is epic. It&#39;s an autobiography, a history, and a manifesto; a massive work of nonfiction incorporating folklore and ecology.&#34; --Zach Dundas, Missoula Independent</p><h2>Tahoe Blue Fire (An Owen McKenna Mystery Thriller)</h2><p>When Tahoe Detective Owen McKenna gets a call from a woman who&#x2019;s afraid for her life, it sounds like she is excessively paranoid.

When McKenna finds a connection between the victims and a famous retired pro football tackle named Adam Simms, he worries that Simms will be the next victim. Simms seems gentle as a teddy bear. But decades of football gave Simms Traumatic Brain Injury, causing loss of memory and worse. When Simms can&#x2019;t remember details of his relationship to the other victims, McKenna begins to wonder if it&#x2019;s because Simms is suffering dementia or if he&#x2019;s a diabolical fake.

The story of how the Polynesians, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Korean, Filipinos, Okinawans, Puerto Ricans, various Southeast Asian peoples, and Caucasians (known as <i>haoles</i>) brought together their culinary traditions on these islands makes fascinating reading. Laudan concentrates on local food rather than the world-class glamour of the Hawaiian regional cuisine cooked up by famous island chefs Amy Ferguson Ota and Roy Yamaguchi. She presents the polyglot world of the plate lunch, Spam, <i>mochi</i>, seaweed, shaved ice, sushi, and all the other dishes that Hawaiians really eat every day. Primarily a living and lively culinary history, this book does include recipes for the most commonplace Hawaiian dishes.Hawaii has one of the richest culinary heritages in the United States. Where else would you find competitions for the best saimin, sushi, Portuguese sausage, laulau, plate lunch, kim chee, dim sum, shave ice, and hamburgers? Hawaii&#39;s contemporary regional cuisine (affectionately known as &#34;Local Food&#34; by residents) is a truly amazing fusion of diverse culinary influences. In The Food of Paradise: Exploring Hawaii&#39;s Culinary Heritage, Rachel Laudan takes readers on a thoughtful, wide-ranging tour of Hawaii&#39;s farms and gardens, fish auctions and vegetable markets, fairs and carnivals, mom-and-pop stores and lunch wagons, to uncover the delightful complexities and incongruities in Hawaii&#39;s culinary history that have led to such creations as saimin, crack seed, and butter mochi. Part personal memoir, part historical narrative, part cookbook, The Food of Paradise begins with a series of essays that describe Laudan&#39;s initial encounter with a particular Local Food, an encounter that puzzled her and eventually led to tracing its origins and influence in Hawaii. Representative recipes follow. Like pidgin, the creole language created by Hawaii&#39;s early immigrants, Local Food is a creole cuisine created by three distinct culinary influences: Pacific, American and European, and Asian. In her attempt &#34;to decipher Hawaii&#39;s culinary Babel&#34;, Laudan examines the contributions of each, including the introduction of new ingredients and the adaptation of traditional dishes to Hawaii&#39;s way of life. More than 150 recipes, photographs, a bibliography of Hawaii&#39;s cookbooks, and an extensive glossary make The Food of Paradise an invaluable resource for cooks, food historians, and Hawaiian buffs.</p><h2>Take Six Girls: The Lives of the Mitford Sisters</h2><p><p></p><p><b><b>'Wonderfully readable ...

Since recent unsettling events, she has made some progress. While she still has writer's block, she doesn't suffer from it. She's still a hermit, but she has allowed some of her class members into her life. She is no longer numb, angry, and sardonic: she is merely numb and bemused, which is as close to happy as she plans to get. Amy is calm.</p><p>So, when on New Year's morning she shuffles out to her backyard garden to plant a Norfolk pine, she is wholly unprepared for what happens next.</p><p>Amy falls down.</p><p>A simple accident, as a result of which something happens, and then something else, and then a number of different things, all as unpredictable as an eight-ball break. At first the changes are small, but as these small events carom off one another, Amy's life changes in ways that range from ridiculous to frightening to profound.</p><p>This most reluctant of adventurers is dragged and propelled by train, plane, and automobile through an outlandish series of antic media events on her way to becoming&#x2015;to her horror&#x2015;a kind of celebrity. And along the way, as the numbness begins to wear off, she comes up against something she has avoided all her life: her future.</p><p>Jincy Willett's <i>Amy Falls Down</i> explores, through the experience of one character, the role that accident plays in all our lives. "You turn a corner and beasts break into arias, gunfire erupts, waking a hundred families, starting a hundred different conversations. You crack your head open and three thousand miles away a stranger with Asperger's jump-starts your career."</p><p>We are all like Amy.

Her house slippers were fuzzy, oversized, and floppy, and if she moved too fast, she would walk right out of them. <br>She was not yet dressed for the day because she had no reason to dress until much later, at which time she&#x2019;d have to dress uncomfortably, and she was in no hurry to do that. At three o&#x2019;clock a reporter from <i>The</i> <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> was coming to interview Amy as part of some bogus series about local writers. Although she&#x2019;d specified no current events and especially no photographs, she didn&#x2019;t trust a reporter who sounded on the phone as though she were eight years old and couldn&#x2019;t think of anything funnier than not wanting your face on public display. Imagine, her laughter implied, denying the world the chance to gaze upon you. So Amy dreaded the interview but was not actively doing so, or thinking about it at all, as she shuffled toward the raised garden with the Norfolk pine. <br>She shuffled past her mimosa tree, where three goldfinches clung to a thistle-seed feeder, and past her green plastic pseudo-Adirondack chairs, covered with two seasons&#x2019; worth of dirt, seeds, and leaves, which she really must hose off one of these days. She shuffled closer to the raised garden, as the screen door banged behind her and Alphonse jingled past and up ahead of her, his great basset nose zeroing in on the very spot where she planned to dig, as though her trail had magically preceded her. James Thurber said that his bloodhound always seemed more interested in where he&#x2019;d been than where he was; Alphonse had an uncanny fascination with where she planned to be, and a genius for thwarting her: ordinarily a sedate plodder, he could materialize in a chair just as she was about to sit down; if she suddenly felt peckish at two in the morning, he&#x2019;d be waiting in front of the refrigerator, his eyes glowing red in the dark kitchen. Now he sniffed round and round the digging spot. &#x201c;No!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Desist, you miscreant!&#x201d; Alphonse feigned deafness, as though so anxious to relieve himself that he could think of nothing else, which was mendacious, as he usually slept in until midmorning and even then typically put off his bathroom break until noon. He was just messing with her head. <br>So she shuffled a little faster, intent on reaching her goal before Alphonse fully committed himself to his, and when she came to the raised garden, her eyes fixed on Alphonse, and lifted her right foot to step onto the low brick wall, she misjudged its elevation by perhaps a quarter inch, not enough to stub her toes and trip, just enough to throw her very slightly off-balance, the sole of her foot catching and scraping on the rough brick rather than coming straight down to meet it, and still she rose, her attention now divided between Alphonse and the heavy potted pine, her center of gravity higher than usual as she clutched it to her midriff, and then the slipper on her left foot did flop off and she did stub her left toes, or rather skinned the tops of them on the harsh edge of the brick, which really shouldn&#x2019;t have been catastrophic, but was, because now she was thinking about three different things, Alphonse, her toes, and the Norfolk pine, so that somehow her balance shifted forward, and certain physical forces, inertia and momentum, began to announce themselves, clearing their throats politely. All was not lost at this point, they said, but a fall was possible, and Amy, over-thinking as usual, realizing that in such a fall the <i>pine</i> might suffer irreparably, focused on cradling it in such a way that <i>it</i> would not suffer, as though she were sixteen years old and lithe and presented with a smorgasbord of landing-position selections, none of which would injure her in the slightest, whereas what she should have done was jettison the damn plant and save herself, but no, and then she had actually lost balance and was pitching forward, her legs and feet heroically striving to catch up with her upper body, so that, still falling, she gathered speed, and, seeing that all was lost, she began to twist around in order to land on her back, and then her bare left heel slammed down on a sprinkler head and she heard her ankle crunch, but felt nothing because within the time it would have taken for the pain message to arrive in her brain, she had knocked herself out on the birdbath. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Jincy Willett <br></p><h2>The Real Astrology</h2><p>Spica Award: International Book of the Year, 2001.

This is her story.</p><p>She met Augustine in Carthage when she was seventeen. She was the poor daughter of a mosaic-layer; he was a promising student and heir to a fortune. His brilliance and passion intoxicated her, but his social class would be forever beyond her reach. She became his concubine, and by the time he was forced to leave her, she was thirty years old and the mother of his son. And his <em>Confessions </em>show us that he never forgot her.

Come back with me to Illinois in the late '90s, when I was a third-year resident at a university in the Midwest, working a 36-hour shift in labor and delivery.<br><br>"Doctor Rankin, Room 305--stat!"<br><br>I burst from the doctors' lounge as if poised on sprinters' blocks, flinging blankets and barbecue potato chips in my wake. I race through the tiled hallways and slam open the door of the delivery room, where the adjustable hospital bed perches, like a throne, in the center of a pink- walled haven that is as homey and cozy as you can make a hospital room. Lying in the center of the bed, I see my patient, Sarah, straddled in the stirrups, her face scarlet as she grabs her knees and pushes until a tiny blood vessel in her eye bursts. Seeing a swath of bright red hair crowning, I throw on a blue paper gown, don a pair of 61/2 sterile gloves, and assume the catcher's mitt stance.<br><br>The baby's father is counting, "One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . . six . . . seven . . . eight . . . nine . . . ten. Okay. Deep breath. And again." Queen's "We Are the Champions" blares from the stereo.<br><br>Massaging Sarah's perineum, I stretch the skin to make room for the baby's head just as she pushes it out with one last grunt. When I angle the baby's head down, the front shoulder pops out, and when I pull up in the opposite direction, the baby boy slips out like a greased watermelon. The father bursts into tears, which leaves me misty. (Something about watching big, burly guys cry at births gets me every time.) As I place the baby boy on the towel waiting on his mother's belly, the nurse dries him off and rubs his back. Sarah nuzzles her son's wet hair against her cheek.<br><br>While the parents bond, I focus on delivering the placenta. But then I hear the nurse press the call button and order, "Call NICU. Stat!" I deliver the placenta and rush to the incubator, where the nurse is inserting suction tubes into the limp newborn's mouth. The nurse whispers, "Baby's not breathing." He looks a dusky shade of purplish blue.<br><br>I rummage around for a stethoscope while the nurse covers the baby's mouth with an oxygen mask. My heart races when I realize I'll have to intubate this baby myself if the team from the neonatal intensive care unit doesn't arrive soon. As a third-year OB/GYN resident, I've only intubated a few babies--and they were all plastic dolls in a controlled setting. I swallow hard, running through the steps in my mind, all the while praying that the NICU team will save this baby--and me.<br><br>Sarah yells, "What's happening? Why isn't my baby crying?"<br><br>The charge nurse pushes the worried father aside and says, "Stay there. Please."<br><br>I can hear Sarah wailing in the background as I'm sorting through the equipment, trying to find just the right tube, with the baby getting bluer by the minute.<br><br>I pray, "Please God please God please God," and then just, "Help."<br><br>I beg the charge nurse to grab my senior resident, the attending physician, the neonatologist--anyone more senior than me who happens to be standing around labor and delivery right now. The stakes are too high. But the charge nurse whispers back, "Lissa, you're it right now."<br><br>I feel a sense of mounting dread. I've never done this before, not on a real baby. What if I screw up?<br><br>I'm just about to insert the tiny laryngoscope into the newborn's mouth when the NICU team races in and someone with more experience than me grabs the instrument from my hand. I breathe a huge sigh. I'm off the hook.<br><br>Within seconds, the baby is intubated and a respiratory therapist starts bag-ventilating him while the NICU nurse listens to his chest with a stethoscope. The NICU nurse yells, "Call a code."<br><br>This is not good. The baby is still blue. My heart sinks.<br><br>The NICU attending neonatologist, Dr. Bosco, blasts in moments later. Without a word to Sarah, he puts a line into the freshly cut umbilical cord, injecting drugs; pushes medication down the endotracheal tube; and, finally, compresses the tiny baby's blue chest, performing CPR.<br><br>By this point, Sarah and her husband are officially freaking out, and my whole body is quivering with adrenaline. The charge nurse sits with her arm around Sarah, and I'm racing between Sarah and the NICU team, trying to translate. But the NICU team is working silently, and I have no clue what's going on.<br><br>Was it me? Did I do something wrong? The baby looked great on the fetal monitor all through labor, and the delivery went smoothly. I second-guess myself, which is what OB/GYNs always do when the baby doesn't come out pink and screaming. I wonder if there's anything I could have done to prevent this baby from being so blue. Had I missed some clue on the fetal monitor? Should I have recommended a C-section? Should I have rushed the delivery with forceps or a vacuum? And the unwelcome thought that always needles its way into the minds of obstetricians when the baby comes out blue: Will I get sued?<br><br>Finally, Dr. Jackson, the attending OB/GYN in charge of me, flings open the door and bellows, "Will somebody tell me what's going on in here?"<br><br>I start debriefing him, but he brushes me aside and starts barking at Dr. Bosco, asking questions in a brusque voice. Dr. Bosco shoos him away. He's fully focused on trying to save the blue baby in front of him. Without a word to any of us, the NICU team pushes the incubator out of the delivery room and runs down the hallway. Dr. Jackson races after them, still barking questions.<br><br>The room is suddenly still with only Sarah, her husband, the nurse, and me left. Sarah and her husband are both sobbing, and when I place my hand over Sarah's hand, she withdraws it, as if I just burned her. I feel helpless. All I can do is stand there and be present, which doesn't feel like enough. Doctors don't like to feel helpless. At all. It triggers our greatest fear-- that others will finally realize that we're imposters, that we don't know what we're doing, that we can't really help our patients, that everything we do is just a finely orchestrated ruse to cover up the truth that we're not in control of whether or not someone lives or dies.<br><br>I feel the sinking sensation in the hollows of my stomach that I always feel when I realize I can't control what happens in the hospital, and just at that moment, when I'm feeling really nauseated, my pager blares a 911 message, which means, "COME NOW." I apologize to Sarah and excuse myself from the room.<br><br>I feel the tears starting to come, but I can't indulge them because there's a baby about to be born in Room 309. Doctors become masters at stuffing their emotions. We can't cry when we're grieving or when someone has hurt our feelings or when we're sad. We can't let on when we're scared. The only emotion doctors seem to give themselves permission to express is anger. Doctors tend to yell a lot. But when you're a resident, you're not even allowed to yell much. You can only yell down to your medical students or junior residents. You can't yell up to the attending physicians. Either way, yelling isn't so much my style. I'm more the crying type, but my professors have been criticizing me for years when I cry, so I try to hold it together and not let anyone see when things get to me.<br><br>It's not just feelings that doctors suppress. We literally have to suppress our urges--to sleep when we're tired, to eat when we're hungry, to stop retracting in surgery when our shoulders are killing us, even to urinate. Looking at the clock, I see that it's past midnight, and I'm so tired and hungry and dizzy from adrenaline that I have a hard time mustering up the energy I'll need to deliver this next baby, but nobody in this labor room needs to know that I'm scared about what's happening to Sarah's baby or that I really want to go to sleep. Let these nice people think I've been hanging out in a call room, reading a good book, just waiting for this very special moment.<br><br>Wiping my eyes and pasting on my smiling game face, I open the door.<br><br>The baby's head is halfway out of Olive's vagina, and the nurse is playing quarterback, holding the head in with one hand while the other hand pulls back for instruments in case the baby comes before I don my gloves. I get there just in time and step between Olive's blue-draped legs as a contraction comes and the baby shoots out like a cannonball. I fumble the baby, barely catching him in the crook of my arm. Then I clamp the umbilical cord twice and invite the dad to cut it. He can barely chop through the rubbery cord, but once he does, he looks so proud, like he's just thrown a touchdown. With the baby boy untethered, I nestle him onto the blanket over Olive's breast.<br><br>Olive gushes, "Oh, my beautiful boy," and the dad tears up and grins. I start to tear up, too. They really do get me every time. But then I look away so I can keep it together.<br><br>While I deliver the placenta and inspect a small tear in Olive's vagina, I say, "Happy birthday, baby. Welcome to the world."<br><br>I load up my needle driver with a little 2-0 chromic, and just as I'm about to put the needle into Olive's flesh, my pager goes off. The nurse frees it from my waist and pushes the little green button, revealing a page from down the hall. I'm wanted in Room 301. I sew quickly, have my photo taken with Olive and the baby, and make my exit.<br><br>In Room 301, all the way at the very end of the labor floor, as far from the sound of happy screaming babies as possible, lies Eve. The charge nurse put her here as an act of compassion, to spare her from the joyful sounds of healthy childbirth, because Eve's birth will not be one of them. When I enter Room 301, I am struck by the unnatural silence. Labor rooms tend to be noisy, chaotic places, but in Room 301, no fetal heart monitor beeps the reassuring bleep-bleep-bleep of a healthy fetal heartbeat. No stereo plays power-pushing tunes or tinkly new age meditation music. The team of people who usually attend a birth are conspicuously absent. Even the grunts and cries emitted from a woman about to give birth are muted by Eve's heavily dosed epidural and a generous hand with the morphine, all aimed at making her as comfortable as possible for something painful on every level.<br><br>Eve was 35 weeks along when she wound up with flulike symptoms, which turned out to be caused by listeriosis, a bacterial infection that killed her almost full-term baby. Eve is now about to give birth to the baby she has already lost. When I first introduced myself to Eve earlier in the day, I sat on the edge of her bed, held her hand, and listened to her tell me about the garden mural she had painted on the nursery wall, the vintage christening dress she had found at an antique store, and the dreams for her future life with this baby that she will never experience.<br><br>Now the baby's head is right here, about to be born. I brace myself.<br><br>Eve pushes, and suddenly, I am holding a grey, lifeless shell of a baby. With silent reverence, the nurse takes the baby girl from my hands and wraps her gingerly in the hand-knit carnation pink blanket donated by the Ladies Auxiliary for women who have lost their babies. The nurse asks Eve whether she wants to hold her baby. Eve nods. We prop her up in bed, and the nurse hands her the baby she has named Amelia. Eve looks so alone with no family at her bedside. My pager is blessedly quiet for a change, so while the nurse finishes up the paperwork, I curl up next to Eve on the labor bed, with my arms around her and her baby. Eve falls asleep in my arms, still holding Amelia.<br><br>"Dr. Rankin to Room 315--stat!" I quietly extricate myself from Eve's embrace and leave the room.<br><br>In Room 315 a whole team of nurses are attending to Mallory. One holds the fetal monitor to her belly while another turns her first right, then left. Someone else is holding a fetal scalp electrode out to me, my signal to do the procedure that will let us more accurately monitor the baby's heartbeat, which is down in the sixties--half of what it should be. When I insert the scalp electrode, I tickle the baby's head, trying to stimulate the baby's heartbeat, but nothing happens. It stays in the sixties.<br><br>Mallory is only 8 centimeters dilated, so I can't grab a pair of forceps or ask her to push. Instead, I yell, "Open the back," my signal to get the operating room ready. Everyone springs to action. The whole time I'm scratching the baby's head with my finger and helping Mallory change positions in hopes that whatever might be compressing the baby's umbilical cord moves out of the way.<br><br>The heartbeat has been down for 4 minutes, but it feels like forever. Then, just as we are about to unplug Mallory from the fetal monitor and race her back to the operating room for a crash C-section, the baby's heart rate goes up. We all slow down and watch every beep of the monitor. I finally exhale. We're out of the woods, at least for now. I allow myself a moment of fatigue, the kind that washes over you like a wave and leaves you fantasizing about feather pillows and flannel bedsheets.<br><br>But there's no time for fantasies. I pull out Mallory's chart and start jotting notes, when the overhead pager goes off again. "Dr. Rankin to Room 307." Sometimes I seriously fantasize about disabling the damn overhead pager. And flushing my beeper down the toilet. And walking out of the hospital in my scrubs, ignoring all the demands and expectations. I imagine just walking and walking and maybe eventually winding up on a beach in California where I don't even own a phone.<br><br>But right now there's another baby to deliver. I run into Room 307; catch the pink, squealing baby; and hug the tearful, happy mother.</p><h2>Black Mountain (An Isaiah Coleridge Novel)</h2><p><b>Ex-Mob enforcer Isaiah Coledrige has hung out a shingle as a private eye in New York's Hudson Valley, and in his newest case, a seemingly simple murder investigation leads him to the most terrifying enemy he has ever faced.</b><br><br>When a small-time criminal named Harold Lee turns up in the Ashokan reservoir--sans a heartbeat, head, or hands--the local Mafia capo hires Isaiah Coleridge to look into the matter.

Kahn's rethinking of modern architecture's paradigm of space belongs to his most important contributions to the metier. In tracing the genesis of the unbuilt project for the Dominican Motherhouse (1965-69), we are given a close-up view of Kahn at work on a few fundamental questions of architectural space: seeking the sources of its meaning in its social, morphological, landscape and contextual dimensions. This rich and multivalent project opens the way to a second section, which sheds new light on several major works in a timely reappraisal of Kahn's work.

But behind the elite there were, in the Royal Flying Corps, many hundreds of other airmen who flew their hazardous daily sorties in outdated planes without ever achieving fame. Here is the story of one of these unknown flyers &#x2013; a story based on letters written on the day, hot on the event, which tells of a young pilot&#x2019;s progress from fledgling to seasoned fighter. His descriptions of air fighting, sometimes against the Richtofen Circus, of breathless dogfights between Sopwith Pup and Albatros, are among the most vivid and immediate to come out of World War I. Gould Lee brilliantly conveys the immediacy of air war, the thrills and the terror, in this honest and timeless account. Rising to the rank of air vice-marshal, Gould Lee never forgot the RFC&#x2019;s needless sacrifices &#x2013; and in a trio of trenchant appendices he examines, with the mature judgment of a senior officer of the RAF and a graduate of the Staff and Imperial Defense Colleges, the failure of the Army High Command to provide both efficient airplanes until mid-1917 and parachutes throughout the war, and General Trenchard&#x2019;s persistence in a costly and largely ineffective conception of the air offensive.</p><p>Arthur Gould Lee was born in 1894 and served in the Sherwood Foresters, RFC, and RAF from 1915 to 1946 when he retired as an air vice-marshal. He took up writing on retirement from the RAF and published eight nonfiction books, all of which have become classics in aviation nonfiction.&#x201c;... new edition nicely complements the earlier work... covers Lee&#x2019;s experiences with No.46 Squadron, RFC, during the shorter but much more intense period from May 1917 to January 1918. It is based largely on his wartime letters and includes as appendices his later observations, reflecting a longer view of history and his experience as a two-star RAF officer...wartime exploits still resonate in the stirring, first-hand narratives contained in this nicely-illustrated book. (<i>Over the Front</i>)<br><br>"This excellent book remains a copper plated gem and has stood the test of time with gusto...This is a very serious book. It takes the form of the letters the author wrote to his young wife and there are odd occasions when he leaves out descriptions of adventures away from flying that I would like to have seen included. It is annotated with details of comrades lost in combat which are very poignant in their own way. A brief account of the later careers of some of his surviving chums appears in the appendices. Make no mistake; what we have here is a classic which gives a genuinely warm and detailed look at the life of a pilot on a typical fighter squadron during the violent days following Bloody April and into the last year of the war. We meet many characters, some with short time on this Earth and others who went on to greatness in another war. It&#x2019;s got the lot."

And now Cubby Greenwich, his wife, Penny, their brilliant six-year-old Milo, and their uniquely talented non-collie, Lassie, are all about to learn the true meaning of &#x201c;culture war.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Dean Koontz,</b> the author of many #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, lives in Southern California with his wife, Gerda, their golden retriever, Elsa, and the enduring spirit of their goldens, Trixie and Anna.<i>Chapter One</i>This is a thing I&#x2019;ve learned: Even with a gun to my head, I am capable of being convulsed with laughter. I am not sure what this extreme capacity for mirth says about me. You&#x2019;ll have to decide for yourself.Beginning one night when I was six years old and for twenty-seven years thereafter, good luck was my constant companion. The guardian angel watching over me had done a superb job.As a reward for his excellent stewardship of my life, perhaps my angel&#x2014;let&#x2019;s call him Ralph&#x2014;was granted a sabbatical. Perhaps he was reassigned. Something sure happened to him for a while during my thirty-fourth year, when darkness found us.In the days when Ralph was diligently on the job, I met and courted Penny Boom. I was twenty-four and she was twenty-three.Women as beautiful as Penny previously looked through me. Oh, occasionally they looked at me, but as though I reminded them of something they had seen once in a book of exotic fungi, something they had never expected&#x2014;or wished&#x2014;to see in real life.She was also too smart and too witty and too graceful to waste her time with a guy like me, so I can only assume that a supernatural power coerced her into marrying me. In my mind&#x2019;s eye, I see Ralph kneeling beside Penny&#x2019;s bed while she slept, whispering, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the one for you, he&#x2019;s the one for you, no matter how absurd that concept may seem at this moment, he really is the one for you.&#x201d;We were married more than three years when she gave birth to Milo, who is fortunate to have his mother&#x2019;s blue eyes and black hair.Our preferred name for our son was Alexander. Penny&#x2019;s mother, Clotilda&#x2014;who is named Nancy on her birth certificate&#x2014;threatened that if we did not call him Milo, she would blow her brains out.Penny&#x2019;s father, Grimbald&#x2014;whose parents named him Larry&#x2014;insisted that he would not clean up after such a suicide, and neither Penny nor I had the stomach for the job. So Alexander became Milo.I am told that the family&#x2019;s surname really is Boom and that they come from a long line of Dutch merchants. When I ask what commodity his ancestors sold, Grimbald becomes solemn and evasive, and Clotilda pretends that she is deaf.My name is Cullen Greenwich&#x2014;pronounced gren-itch, like the town in Connecticut. Since I was a little boy, most people have called me Cubby.When I first dated Penny, her mom tried calling me Hildebrand, but I would have none of it.Hildebrand is from the Old German, and means &#x201c;battle torch&#x201d; or &#x201c;battle sword.&#x201d; Clotilda is fond of power names, except in the case of our son, when she was prepared to self-destruct if we didn&#x2019;t give him a name that meant &#x201c;beloved and gentle.&#x201d;Our friend and internist, Dr. Jubal Frost, who delivered Milo, swears that the boy never cried at birth, that he was born smiling. In fact, Jubal says our infant softly hummed a tune, on and off, in the delivery room.Although I was present at the birth, I have no memory of Milo&#x2019;s musical performance because I fainted. Penny does not remember it either, because, although conscious, she was distracted by the postpartum hemorrhaging that had caused me to pass out.I do not doubt Jubal Frost&#x2019;s story. Milo has always been full of surprises. For good reason, his nickname is Spooky.On his third birthday, Milo declared, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna rescue a doggy.&#x201d;Penny and I assumed he was acting out something he had seen on TV, but he was a preschooler on a mission. He climbed onto a kitchen chair, plucked the car keys from the Peg&#x2013;Board, and hurried out to the garage as if to set off in search of an endangered canine.We took the keys away from him, but for more than an hour, he followed us around chanting, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna rescue a doggy,&#x201d; until to save our sanity, we decided to drive him to a pet shop and redirect his canine enthusiasm toward a gerbil or a turtle, or both.En route, he said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost to the doggy.&#x201d; Half a block later, he pointed to a sign&#x2014;animal shelter. We assumed wrongly that it was the silhouette of a German shepherd that caught his attention, not the words on the sign. &#x201c;In there, Daddy.&#x201d;Scores of forlorn dogs occupied cages, but Milo walked directly to the middle of the center row in the kennel and said, &#x201c;This one.&#x201d;She was a fifty-pound two-year-old Australian shepherd mix with a shaggy black-and-white coat, one eye blue and the other gray. She had no collie in her, but Milo named her Lassie.Penny and I loved her the moment we saw her. Somewhere a gerbil and a turtle would remain in need of a home.In the next three years, we never heard a single bark from the dog. We wondered whether our Lassie, following the example of the original, would at last bark if Milo fell down an abandoned well or became trapped in a burning barn, or whether she would instead try to alert us to our boy&#x2019;s circumstances by employing urgent pantomime.Until Milo was six and Lassie was five, our lives were not only free of calamity but also without much inconvenience. Our fortunes changed with the publication of my sixth novel, One O&#x2019;Clock Jump.My first five had been bestsellers. Way to go, Angel Ralph.Penny Boom, of course, is the Penny Boom, the acclaimed writer and illustrator of children&#x2019;s books. They are brilliant, funny books.More than for her dazzling beauty, more than for her quick mind, more than for her great good heart, I fell in love with her for her sense of humor. If she ever lost her sense of humor, I would have to dump her. Then I&#x2019;d kill myself because I couldn&#x2019;t live without her.The name on her birth certificate is Brunhild, which means someone who is armored for the fight. By the time she was five, she insisted on being called Penny.At the start of World War Waxx, as we came to call it, Penny and Milo and Lassie and I lived in a fine stone-and-stucco house, under the benediction of graceful phoenix palms, in Southern California. We didn&#x2019;t have an ocean view, but didn&#x2019;t need one, for we were focused on one another and on our books.Because we&#x2019;d seen our share of Batman movies, we knew that Evil with a capital E stalked the world, but we never expected that it would suddenly, intently turn its attention to our happy household or that this evil would be drawn to us by a book I had written.Having done a twenty-city tour for each of my previous novels, I persuaded my publisher to spare me that ordeal for One O&#x2019;Clock Jump.Consequently, on publication day, a Tuesday in early November, I got up at three o&#x2019;clock in the morning to brew a pot of coffee and to repair to my first-floor study. Unshaven, in pajamas, I undertook a series of thirty radio interviews, conducted by telephone, between 4:00 and 9:30 a.m., which began with morning shows on the East Coast.Radio hosts, both talk-jocks and traditional tune-spinners, do better interviews than TV types. Rare is the TV interviewer who has read your book, but eight of ten radio hosts will have read it.Radio folks are brighter and funnier, too&#x2014;and often quite humble. I don&#x2019;t know why this last should be true, except perhaps the greater fame of facial recognition, which comes with regular television exposure, encourages pridefulness that ripens into arrogance.After five hours on radio, I felt as though I might vomit if I heard myself say again the words One O&#x2019;Clock Jump. I could see the day coming when, if I was required to do much publicity for a new book, I would write it but not allow its publication until I died.If you have never been in the public eye, flogging your work like a carnival barker pitching a freak show to the crowd, this publish-only-after-death pledge may seem extreme. But protracted self-promotion drains something essential from the soul, and after one of these sessions, you need weeks to recover and to decide that one day it might be all right to like yourself again.The danger in writing but not publishing was that my agent, Hudson &#x201c;Hud&#x201d; Jacklight, receiving no commissions, would wait only until three unpublished works had been completed before having me killed to free up the manuscripts for marketing.And if I knew Hud as well as I thought I did, he would not arrange for a clean shot to the back of the head. He would want me to be tortured and dismembered in such a flamboyant fashion that he could make a rich deal for one of his true-crime clients to write a book about my murder.If no publisher would pay a suitably immense advance for a book about an unsolved killing, Hud would have someone framed for it. Most likely Penny, Milo, and Lassie.Anyway, after the thirtieth interview, I rose from my office chair and, reeling in self-disgust, made my way to the kitchen. My intention was to eat such an unhealthy breakfast that my guilt over the cholesterol content would distract me from the embarrassment of all the self-promotion.Dependable Penny had delayed her breakfast so she could eat with me and hear all of the incredibly witty things I wished I had said in those thirty interviews. In contrast to my tousled hair, unshaven face, and badly rumpled pajamas, she wore a crisp white blouse and lemon-yellow slacks, and as usual her skin glowed as though it were translucent and she were lit from inside.As I entered the room, she was serving blueberry pancakes, and I said, &#x201c;You look scrumptious. I could pour maple syrup on you and eat you alive.&#x201d;&#x201c;Cannibalism,&#x201d; Milo warned me, &#x201c;is a crime.&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a worldwide crime,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Some places it&#x2019;s a culinary preference.&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a crime,&#x201d; he insisted.Between his fifth and sixth birthdays, Milo had decided on a career in law enforcement. He said that too many people were lawless and that the world was run by thugs. He was going to grow up and do something about it.Lots of kids want to be policemen. Milo intended to become the director of the FBI and the secretary of defense, so that he would be empowered to dispense justice to evildoers both at home and abroad.Here on the brink of World War Waxx, Milo perched on a dinette chair, elevated by a thick foam pillow because he was diminutive for his age. Blue block letters on his white T-shirt spelled courage.Later, the word on his chest would seem like an omen.Having finished his breakfast long ago, my bright-eyed son was nursing a glass of chocolate milk and reading a comic book. He could read at college level, though his interests were not those of either a six-year-old or a frat boy.</p><h2>You Matter to God: Discovering Your True Value and Identity in God&#39;s Eyes</h2><p>In his clear and accessible signature style, Derek Prince employs his extraordinary understanding of Scripture to lay out the depth of Jesus&#39;s great love for individuals and to help them discover their worth.

She didn&#x2019;t feel the cold as she stared down at the frail beauty on the bed cocooned in threadbare blankets. The woman drew in a rattling breath, and suddenly Jassy became aware of her surroundings, the unpainted rafters that barely held the walls together, the smut from the candles, the ancient trunk at the foot of the bed holding their few belongings, the cold that ever seeped in upon them. Jassy swallowed and her jaw locked tightly as tears pricked her eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;ll not die like this! she swore to herself. I&#x2019;ll not let her! I shall beg, borrow, or steal, but so help me God, I shall not let her die like this!<br> &nbsp;<br> But even as Jassy silently made her vows, old Tamsyn was staring at her sadly, shaking his head just slightly, in a way not meant to be seen, and certainly not understood. But Jassy understood the motion all too well; Tamsyn had already given up all hope on Linnet Dupr�.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Quinine, girl. Quinine might help to ease her misery some, but that be all I can tell you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tears welled anew in her eyes; she could not allow them to fall. Impatiently she brushed her small, work-roughened hands across her temple, raising her chin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tamsyn was wrong, she assured herself. He had to be wrong. What was Tamsyn but another beaten-down drunk to have found his livelihood with the rest of them at the Crossroads Inn? He claimed to have once been a physician who had even studied long ago at Oxford, but perhaps that was a lie. A lie like the dreams he had spun for her of a new day to come, of distant lands and faraway places, exotic voyages and emerald seas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her mother was dying. She had no time for dreams, and she dared not fall prey to despair.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Quinine,&#x201d; Jassy said briskly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Quinine,&#x201d; Tamsyn repeated. &#x201c;But ye may as well wish for the moon, Jassy, lass. The cost of a dose&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His words trailed away, and Jassy gnawed bitterly into her lower lip. The cost for anything was dear when her mother&#x2019;s wages at the inn came to no more than one gold coin and a bolt of cloth a year.<br> &nbsp;<br> And when she was paid nothing herself, as well. Nothing, since she apprenticed to the cook and her endeavors would not be considered worthy of coin until she had completed five years of service.<br> &nbsp;<br> She lowered her head suddenly, whispering in desperation, &#x201c;I can beg Master John&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Save your breath, girl,&#x201d; Tamsyn warned her. &#x201c;Master John will give you naught.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And she knew that he was right. The customers ate great platters of meat with rich gravy, they drank tankards of ale and imported French wines. Master John was quick to buy a round of drinks, generous to all his customers.<br> &nbsp;<br> To his servants he was mean and cheap.<br> &nbsp;<br> And, Jassy thought was a little sigh, they had stayed, anyway, knowing that he was stingy and even cruel at times. They had stayed, for Linnet had always been fragile, not cut out to work, and only here, where they could share this little attic hovel and Jassy could do the majority of her mother&#x2019;s work could they hope to survive.<br> &nbsp;<br> A slight whimpering sound came from the bed. Jassy rushed to her mother&#x2019;s side, kneeling down beside her, grasping her frail hand in her own. Her tears almost spilled then. Linnet did not appear real at all, but as some fairy queen. Even now she was fine and beautiful&#x2014;now, when death lay a claim upon her. Nay, not death! Jassy swore. She would be hanged before she would see her mother die here, beautiful, beautiful Linnet, never intended for such a life in such a horrid, squalid place.<br> &nbsp;<br> Linnet&#x2019;s eyes opened, glazed with fever, all the more beautiful for that glaze. They were truly violet eyes, not blue, not gray, but deep, beautiful violet. A violet as lovely as the gold of her hair and the parchment-pale, but perfect, oval of her face.<br> &nbsp;<br> A face not old in years but made to appear so by years of care and struggle.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mama!&#x201d; Jassy gripped her hand warmly. &#x201c;I am here!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then panic struck her, for Linnet did not recognize her. She spoke to the past, to people no longer present. &#x201c;Is that you, Malden? Tell Sheffield that the curtain must be held, for I am feeling poorly, and that twit of a girl is no understudy to take on the role of Lady Macbeth!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Again tears burned beneath Jassy&#x2019;s lids, and dark despair seized hold of her. Linnet, she saw, was losing her slender grip upon reality, upon life. She reverted quickly to days gone by. To a tender past, a far grander place than the present. For Linnet Dupr� had not always been cast into such a lowly state in life&#x2014;nay, she had most oft been cast as a princess or an heiress. She had reigned as a queen, a queen in the London theatrical community. She had traveled to Paris and Rome; she had been welcomed and applauded throughout the Christian world.<br> &nbsp;<br> In those days she had been courted by dukes and earls, by nobility and grandeur.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somewhere among that grandeur she had produced Jassy.<br> &nbsp;<br> And for many, many years Jassy had lived in grandeur too. Her mother had housed a multitude of servants&#x2014;and treated them kindly! There had been Remington to answer the bell and look after the house; old Mary to cook; Sally Frampton from nearby Waverly to bathe her mother in rich lotions and dress her hair in the latest styles. There had been Brother Anthony to teach Jassy French and Latin, Miss Nellie to teach her to dance, and Herr Hofinger to teach her all about the world at large, the oceans and the rivers, the Romans and the Gauls. He, too, had filled her head with fantasy; stories about the explorer, Columbus; about the New World, the Colonies, the Americas and the Indians. He had told her tales about the Spaniards and the great defeat of the Armada, and how the English still met and tangled with the Spaniards on the sea, claiming pieces of the New World. And he had told her stories about the great houses and mansions and castles within England, and in her dreams she had been swept off her feet by a golden knight and taken to a glorious castle to reign evermore as its mistress. In those dreams Linnet would never be exhausted or overburdened. She would sit at ease and elegantly pour tea from a silver server, and she would be dressed in silk and velvet and fur.<br> &nbsp;<br> That had all been a dream, in a far distant and different life.<br> &nbsp;<br> There had come that long dry spell when Linnet had not been able to obtain a role in the theater. And Linnet had never bothered with her own finances, so she was in complete shock and distress to learn that not only did she not have the money to take a smaller house, but also was so far in debt that the gaping jaws of Newgate Prison awaited her eagerly as her fate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some godsend fell upon them then; miraculously a mysterious &#x201c;donor&#x201d; kept them discreetly from distress.<br> &nbsp;<br> Linnet knew what had occurred; she would not tell Jassy, as Jassy was but a nine-year-old child.<br> &nbsp;<br> But by the age of ten, Jassy understood servants&#x2019; gossip. They all whispered about the Duke of Somerfield having &#x201c;done something fair&#x201d; for her mother at long last.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then they stared at her, and through little George, the cook&#x2019;s son, she learned that she was &#x201c;illy-gitmit&#x201d; and that everyone thought that the duke, who had had &#x201c;illy-cit&#x201d; relations with her mother, should have surely pulled them out of trouble long before.<br> &nbsp;<br> Such rumors were lovely dreams to Jassy at first; she imagined that her father would be a great, handsome man in his prime; that one day she should appear in his great hall and that he would instantly think her beautiful and accomplished and love and adore her above all his legitimate offspring. Then he, of course, could introduce her to the handsome golden knight who would sweep her away to her own castle.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t to be. At the little kitchen breakfast table they could then afford, Linnet jumped up one morning, screamed, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jassy rushed to help her, as did Mary. Mary muttered, wondering what could have caused such a thing. But Jassy then picked up the paper, being able to read as Mary could not, and quickly perused the page, learning then that the duke had been killed most ingloriously in an outlawed duel.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no one to pay the rent on the small house. One by one the servants went. Then the house went, and then the very last of their precious hoard of gold coins and pounds sterling. Linnet could not find work in the London theater again&#x2014;the duke&#x2019;s vicious duchess was busy seeing that no establishment would have her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jassy quickly realized that they must find work. In time Linnet knew, too, that menial work would be their hope of survival, Newgate awaiting any man or woman who did not meet their obligations.<br> &nbsp;<br> She also discovered that she was singularly talentless when it came to working for a living, and in the end she was forced to become the scullery maid at the inn, work totally unsuited to her lovely, fragile form.<br> &nbsp;<br> Master John hired them on only because Jassy was twelve by then, in the peak of health, easily able to work the full fourteen-hour day that her mother could not.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jassy was jerked back to the present as Linnet moved fretfully on the bed, speaking again.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Anabasis</h2><p>This internationally famous poem by the 1960 Nobel laureate was introduced to English-language readers in this translation by T.

There, he received his first exposure to political affairs. In 1921 in Washington, while taking part in a conference on disarmament, he was noticed by Aristide Briand, the then-Prime Minister of France, who recruited him as his assistant.

That's Todd Parr's story, and he's sticking with it (as reinforced by his <i>It's Okay to Be Different</i>, <i>This Is My Hair</i>, and lots more funky, friendly picture books).

The collection includes writings from such well-known and venerable masters as Milarepa, Padmasambhava, Shantideva, Ch�gyam Trungpa, and Tulku Urgyen. <br><br>The concept of Dzogchen is said to lie beyond the confines of our beliefs, our intellectual constructs, our ordinary understanding. A Dzogchen master writes, "We need to dismantle our fixation on the permanence of what we experience. A normal person clings to his experiences as being 'real,' concrete, and permanent. But if we look closely at what happens, experience is simply experience, and it is not made out of anything. It has no form, no sound, no color, no taste, no texture; it is simply empty cognizance." <br><br> <i>The Dzogchen Primer </i> includes an informative editor's preface as well as two forewords by prominent Tibetan masters that provide fundamental background information that will be helpful to readers new to this subject. The book also includes short, descriptive guiding notes intended to assist both independent students and teachers leading workshops.</p><p>Marcia Binder Schmidt has been an editor and publisher of books on Vajrayana Buddhism for over fifteen years. With her husband, author and translator Erik Pema Kungsang, she founded and currently runs Rangjung Yeshe Publications, an independent publisher of Buddhist texts in English.(Tibetan Buddhism/Meditation)Dzogchen (pronounced Zog-chen), also known as The Great Perfection, is arguably the heart of Tibetan Buddhist meditation, and in this impressive collection Schmidt pulls together writings from historic and contemporary masters to facilitate study for serious, committed beginners and longtime practitioners. In 35 generally short essays, students can delve into topics such as Re-enlightenment and The True Foundation by recently deceased (1996) Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, who transmitted the complete teachings of the last century's three great masters and who has 10 passages here. They can also find more ancient voices such as the seventh century's Shantideva on the The Excellence of Bodhichitta, or Milarepa, one of Tibet's most famous yogis and poets, who lived 1,000 years ago, on The Song of Realization. This sequential manual is designed to aid individuals as well as Sangha or workshop leaders, and offers facilitator guidelines, a glossary, author profiles and a bibliography. This primer can help students without a teacher or meditation center, but the volume quickly points out that time in the presence of living masters is essential. Not a collection of academic ruminations, this important work also stresses application. As Ch^kyi Nyima Rinpoche says in the introduction, We do not need to let the teachings remain as mere words or ideas; we can put them to use in our own experience. This is how the buddha nature can be revealed, since it is already present in every one of us. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Duke of Shadows</h2><p><i>In a debut romance as passionate and sweeping as the British Empire, Meredith Duran paints a powerful picture of an aristocrat torn between two worlds, an heiress who dares to risk everything...and the love born in fire and darkness that nearly destroys them.</i> <br> <br> <i>From exotic sandstone palaces...</i> <br> <br> Sick of tragedy, done with rebellion, Emmaline Martin vows to settle quietly into British Indian society. But when the pillars of privilege topple, her fianc�'s betrayal leaves Emma no choice. She must turn for help to the one man whom she should not trust, but cannot resist: Julian Sinclair, the dangerous and dazzling heir to the Duke of Auburn. <br> <br> <i>To the marble halls of London...</i> <br> <br> In London, they toast Sinclair with champagne. In India, they call him a traitor. Cynical and impatient with both worlds, Julian has never imagined that the place he might belong is in the embrace of a woman with a reluctant laugh and haunted eyes. But in a time of terrible darkness, he and Emma will discover that love itself can be perilous -- and that a single decision can alter one's life forever. <br> <br> <i>Destiny follows wherever you run.</i> <br> <br> A lifetime of grief later, in a cold London spring, Emma and Julian must finally confront the truth: no matter how hard one tries to deny it, some pasts cannot be disowned...and some passions never die.</p><p>Meredith Duran is the <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling author of thirteen novels. She blames Anne Boleyn for sparking her lifelong obsession with British history (and for convincing her that princely love is no prize if it doesn&#x2019;t come with a happily-ever-after). She enjoys collecting old etiquette manuals, guidebooks to nineteenth-century London, and travelogues by intrepid Victorian women.<i> One <p> Delhi </p> <p> May 1857 </p> </i> <p> </p> <p> Julian first noticed her because she looked so bored. Waiting for the Commissioner's arrival had put him on edge. He stood at the top of the room, half attending to the feverish chatter around him, his eyes fixed on the door. Rumors in the bazaar daily grew darker, and it was clear to him now that if Calcutta would not act, the local government must. Tonight he meant to exact a promise on that account. </p> <p> He became aware of the woman gradually. It was her stillness that drew his attention. She was leaning against a wall, not ten feet away. Though several people surrounded her, sipping negligently at their wine and laughing, she seemed somehow apart. Tired of it all. Her eyes, which had been resting vacantly on the space over his shoulder, focused on him. They were a penetrating blue, and gave Julian a start. He saw that she was not bored at all, but unhappy. </p> <p> She looked away. </p> <p> He spotted her next in the green room, after the Commissioner slipped out of his grasp. "After dinner," the man mumbled, "if you truly insist on mixing business with pleasure, I would be most, most honored to speak with you." When Julian wheeled away in abrupt, frustrated dismissal, he discovered her behind him, the wineglass halfway to her lips. Again their eyes met, and she lowered the glass. </p> <p> "Sir," she said evenly, bobbing a shallow curtsy. Something in her tone indicated she'd overheard the tail end of his argument with Fraser. He opened his mouth to respond -- after all, the lady had seemed to be waiting for him -- but she had already retreated in a swish of cornflower silk, and he was not in the mood for a chase. </p> <p> He began to wonder about the coincidence when she drifted after him into the garden. Was she following him? In London he might have felt some faint, predatory stirring of interest -- he enjoyed women, particularly those who spared him the trouble of pursuit -- but he had a policy of avoiding memsahibs. Their husbands were rarely understanding, and they themselves tended to be so bored by life on a British station that passing love affairs quickly inflated to their entire reason for being. There was also an absurd set of ideas circulating about him in Anglo-Indian circles, variations on the theme of exotic Eastern eroticism, and he'd long since grown weary of it. </p> <p> But she did not, in fact, seem to know he was there. She paused at the edge of the lawn, one hand coming to her throat, and seemed content to stand there, an abstracted look on her face. A breeze came over the grass, and her fingers loosened, letting the shawl flutter around her shoulders. Fleetingly, her pale lips curved in a smile. </p> <p> Again, he was struck by the impression that she stood at a great remove from the scene around her. Curious. He studied her more closely, finding nothing of special note. Her hair was an unremarkable color, a curling, sun-faded dun that, in conjunction with her pale skin, made it seem as though all the energy of her being were focused in the brilliance of her deep blue eyes. A very odd sort of beauty, if a beauty at all. He wondered if she had recently been ill. </p> <p> The thought made him impatient with himself. She was young, no more than twenty-two or -three years, with smooth white skin that bespoke a typical memsahib's routine. What was there to wonder about her? She would spend her days closeted in a bungalow, reading or at needlepoint. When the monotony began to wear, she would take heart in her zealous belief that the English way of life was the only one of merit in the world. </p> <p> She muttered something beneath her breath. Despite himself, he leaned forward. He could not quite make it out. Surely she had not said -- </p> <p> With a violent gesture, she splashed her wine into the bushes. "Pig swill," she said clearly. </p> <p> </p> <p> The garden was not cool, but it was quiet. Emma turned her face into the sultry breeze and let her eyes drift shut. Had Mrs. Greeley been speaking the truth? Either way, the woman must have been surprised at Emma's impassive reception of the news. It was unpleasant, of course; one didn't often learn that one's betrothed was conducting a torrid affair with a married woman. But the act seemed entirely in keeping with the person Marcus had become since their engagement. </p> <p> Perhaps it was this land that had changed him so. Emma had been here only a few weeks, but already she sensed that India had taken hold of her: loosening her tongue, widening her eyes. Even now, when her mind should have been racing with the implications of Mrs. Greeley's words, the gentle swaying of the trees and the parrots twittering in the branches above distracted her from thought. The night air mantled her bare shoulders, thick and warm, so richly perfumed with night-blooming jasmine that she wondered if she would carry the scent back inside with her. </p> <p> A bullock lowed in the distance. She felt a brief stirring of pity, imagining he was confused at the excess of liberty granted him by the native culture. As to why the cattle were encouraged to wander through the streets, Marcus had told her that the Hindus believed them to be some sort of deities, but he hadn't been able to elaborate. Marcus was often impatient with details. </p> <p> This party, for instance. He should have told her, given her some warning regarding the people she would meet. Within five minutes it had become clear that Delhi society was no friend to her, that news of the shipwreck and her "dishonorable" rescue had tainted local opinion. Instead he'd let her march inside like a lamb to the slaughter, encouraging her to mingle with the sharp-tongued harpies whilst he conferred with the Commissioner. </p> <p> All this, and then to discover he was having an affair with the hostess! </p> <p> Well, it was clear that whatever they did when alone together, Marcus had not reviewed Mrs. Eversham's wine list for her. <i>He</i> was possessed of impeccable taste. With a scoff she tossed the remnants of her Bordeaux into the shrubbery. "Pig swill!" </p> <p> The quiet laugh startled her, and she gasped, squinting into the shadows. "Who's there?" </p> <p> A form emerged from the trees, offering her a toast from a silver flask. "Pig swill indeed," he said, and lifted the pocket-pistol to his lips for a long swallow. </p> <p> She relaxed slightly at the Oxford drawl, which complemented a deliciously low, rough voice. "Pray do not relay my sentiments to our hostess, sir." <i>Or perhaps do,</i> she added silently. </p> <p> Another step brought him full out of darkness, and she caught her breath. It was the man from indoors -- the one with whom she had nearly collided earlier. Once again, his height took her off guard. He was taller even than Marcus, and a full head over her own considerable height. </p> <p> His eyes were a luminescent green-gold, catlike as they reflected the faint light spilling from the bungalow. They watched her as though he waited for something. </p> <p> "Are we acquainted?" she blurted out -- knowing very well they were not. </p> <p> He gave her a faint smile. "No." </p> <p> When he said nothing more, she arched a brow, returning rude stare for rude stare. At least, she hoped it was rude, for she suspected she might be ogling him. The man was unnervingly handsome -- like something from a fever dream, brilliant and fierce, skin touched by gold and hair so black it absorbed the light. Earlier, indoors, she had found herself looking at him, thinking his face begged to be sketched. It would take only a few economical strokes -- sharp, angular slashes for the cheek-bones, a bold straight line for his nose, a fierce square for his jaw. Perhaps his lips would take more time. They were full and mobile, and saved his countenance from sternness. </p> <p> He was very tanned. Doubt flickered through her mind, quashed as she considered his starched cravat and elegantly cut tailcoat. Of course he was English. The lazy grace with which he held himself made her aware of her own unmannerly slouch. She straightened, lifting her face toward the stars. </p> <p> "A lovely night," she said. </p> <p> "Pleasant weather," he agreed, eliciting a startled laugh from her. </p> <p> "You must be joking!" she said, when he tilted his head in question. "It's dreadfully hot." </p> <p> "Do you think so?" He shrugged. "Then I suggest you withdraw to Almora. The hill stations are quite popular this time of year." </p> <p> His reference to the tradition of retreating to the Himalayan foothills during the hot weather sounded almost contemptuous. "You don't plan to go?" </p> <p> "Business holds me here." </p> <p> "Business. You're with the Company, then?" Most everyone she had met so far was in the employ of the East India Company, either as a civil servant or, like Marcus, as an officer in the army. </p> <p> But he appeared mightily amused by the idea. "Dear God, no. I see my reputation does not precede me." </p> <p> "Oh, is it very bad?" The question was out of her mouth before she could reconsider, and she blushed as he laughed again. </p> <p> "It's even worse." </p> <p> When she realized he wasn't going to elaborate, she ventured to continue. "You'll have to tell me about it yourself; I've only just arrived in Delhi, you see." </p> <p> "Really?" He sounded surprised. "I didn't know they raised chits like you in England." </p> <p> "Chits like me?" She frowned. He had settled back against a tree trunk and was smiling at her indulgently, as if -- suddenly it came to her -- she were some three-year-old who had just shown him a neat trick with her doll. "Are you being insulting?" </p> <p> "I meant you seem to have some spirit." </p> <p> "You <i>are</i> being insulting," she decided. "To me and England both." </p> <p> "Well then." He sighed and rolled his shoulders; his coat fit closely enough to reveal the ripple of arm muscles beneath the fabric. She wondered what he had done to acquire them; it was not at all the fashion. "Now you've discovered the first part of my reputation. I am considered terribly ill-mannered." </p> <p> "But I knew that the moment I saw you! A gentleman would refrain from drinking spirits in the presence of a lady." </p> <p> His brows rose. "And a lady would not call her hostess's wine -- what was it? Pig swill, I belie...</p></p><h2>Jung on Evil</h2><p><p>Well-known for his articulation of the "shadow side" of human individuality and culture, C. G. Jung wrote a great deal about the question of evil throughout his life and in scattered places in his work. In this book his position is pieced together from many sources. In his early work on the unconscious, for instance, he considered the role of evil in the mental processes of the severely disturbed. Later, he viewed the question of moral choice within the framework of his ideas about archetypes and discussions about moral choices, conscience, and the continual ethical reflection that is necessary for all of us. The material here includes letters to Freud and Father Victor White and selections from his writings ranging from his <i>Answer to Job</i> to his travel piece on North Africa.</p></p><p><b>Murray Stein</b> is a Jungian analyst in private practice.

Combining his astute historical analysis with a semi-biographical examination of Wellington, Holmes artfully illustrates the rapid evolution in military and political thinking of the time.</p><p>Wellington is a brilliant figure, idealistic in politics, cynical in love, a wit, a beau, a man of enormous courage often sickened by war. As Richard Holmes charts his progress from a shy, indolent boy to commander-in-chief of the allied forces, he also exposes the Iron Duke as a philanderer, and a man who sometimes despised the men that he led, and was not always in control of his soldiers.

Holmes excavates a brilliant figure, idealistic in politics, cynical in love, a wit, a beau, a man of enormous courage and iron duty often sickened by the horrors of war. However, Wellington's journey to greatness and recognition as the man who saved Europe from the tyranny of Napoleon, includes tales of philandering and exposes a man who sometimes despised the men he led, and was not always in control of them.</p><p>THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON WAS NOT ALWAYS GOOD, BUT HE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY GREAT, AND THIS LIVELY AND INFORMED BOOK IS SOCIAL, MILITARY AND BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY AT ITS FINEST</p><p>"Holmes has written the best life of Wellington that there is...Richard Holmes has returned from his long quest with an historical holy grail; the true character of Britain's grittiest soldier."<br>ANDREW ROBERTS, 'Sunday Telegraph'</p><p>Richard Holmes was one of Britain&#x2019;s most distinguished and eminent military historians and broadcasters.

John McKnight shows how competent communities have been invaded and colonized by professionalized services&#x2014;often with devastating results. Overwhelmed by these social services, the spirit of community falters: families collapse, schools fail, violence spreads, and medical systems spiral out of control. Instead of more or better services, the basis for resolving many of America's social problems is the community capacity of the local citizens.</p><p>An illuminating look at how the experts&#39; best efforts to rebuild and revitalize communities are in fact destroying them.Amid all the hand-wringing about the loss of community in America these days, here is a book that celebrates the ability of neighborhoods to heal from within. John McKnight tells how the experts&#39; best efforts to rebuild and revitalize communities are in fact destroying them. McKnight focuses on four &#34;counterfeiting&#34; aspects of society: professionalism, medicine, human service systems, and the criminal justice system. Because in many areas the ideological roots of service grow from a religious ideal, the book concludes with a reflection on the idea of Christian service and its transformation into carelessness. Reforming our human service institutions won&#39;t work, McKnight writes. These systems do too much, intervene where they are ineffective, and try to substitute service for irreplaceable care. Instead of more or better services, the book demonstrates that the community capacity of the local citizens is the basis for resolving many of America&#39;s social problems.</p><h2>Sun and Moon: A Story of Astronomy, Photography and Cartography</h2><p><p><strong>A unique pictorial history of astronomical exploration from the earliest prehistoric observatories to the latest satellite images</strong></p> <p>With 280 spectacular images and an inspiring story imparting the excitement of discovery, <em>Sun and Moon</em> marks the anniversary of the first moon landing by Apollo 11 in July 1969, and the 40th anniversary of NASA's geological survey of the moon, with its extraordinary cartography.</p> <p>It illustrates how the development of photography and cartography - the means of documenting other worlds - is linked indelibly to the charting of the heavens, from the first image on a glass plate to the Hubble Space Telescope.</p> <p><em>Sun and Moon</em> is the gift of the season for anyone who has ever gazed at the stars or looked through a telescope.</p></p><p><p>Mark Holborn is an editor and book designer who has worked internationally with such diverse artists as Lucian Freud, Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Issey Miyake, William Eggleston and James Turrell.

She lives in Minneapolis with her husband, Dan.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>"Next year at this time, I want carpenters working on our house," Mama said. &nbsp; <br><br>Papa said nothing. He was reading the paper while Mama made supper. We were having fried pork chops, mashed potatoes with gravy, and Monarch brand canned peas. Mama had baked a couple of apple pies that morning. She never made fewer than two. Papa couldeat almost a whole pie at a sitting. &nbsp; <br><br>Mama liked to bake pies, and everyone said she was the best pie baker in Harvester, Minnesota. "That's because the crust is thin and crisp," she had explained to me, "and the filling isn't runny." She'd added quickly, "But I never use tapioca or cornstarchto thicken up the fruit pies." Her tone implied that moral turpitude was responsible for pies with tapioca or cornstarch. &nbsp; <br><br>Mama's hair was in pin curls because she was going to her bridge club after supper. Bridge club met every other week on Friday. Tonight Bernice McGivern was hostess. &nbsp; <br><br>Mama carried the platter of chops and the bowl of peas to the table, then returned to the stove for the potatoes and gravy. Seating herself, she filled my plate, mashed potatoes first. I scooped out a well in the center for the gravy, and she took careto pour it into the depression. Mindfully laying my chop to one side of the potatoes, she spooned peas onto the other. &nbsp; <br><br>Papa folded the paper and put it on the floor under his chair. Taking up his fork, he reached across and dragged the tines through my potatoes, laying waste to the dam. Then he laughed as though it were a great joke, which only Mama and I would fail tosee. &nbsp; <br><br>"Why did you do that, Willie? You know she likes to save the potatoes for last." &nbsp; <br><br>"For Christ's sake, Arlene. You gonna pick a fight over mashed potatoes?" he asked, continuing to laugh. Papa laughed a good deal, and everyone said he was a good-natured fellow. A real sport, they said. Mama set her jaw and passed him the chops. &nbsp;<br><br>With my fingers and my spoon, I shored up the ravaged well. &nbsp; <br><br>"Don't use your fingers, Lark," Mama admonished. &nbsp; <br><br>Mama had chosen the name Lark. Lark Browning Erhardt. Browning was Mama's maiden name. Papa had wanted to call me Beverly Mary; Mary after the Blessed Virgin. Mama said she wouldn't hang a name like Beverly Mary on a pet skunk. Where she got the idea forLark, I don't know, although one time when I asked, she said that larks flew high and had a happy song. &nbsp; <br><br>When Mama told Father Delias that I was going to be named Lark Browning, he said it wouldn't do; I had to have a saint's name. Mama, who was a convert, didn't understand that but she went along. On my baptismal certificate I was Lark Ann Browning Erhardt. &nbsp; <br><br>Mama hated her own name, Arlene. "Arlene, Marlene, Darlene, they're all hayseed names," she deplored. Even more than Arlene, she hated "Lena," which she'd been called in school, growing up. Once when Papa called her Lena, just to get her goat, she threwa mustard jar at him. &nbsp; <br><br>Rising, Mama came around to my side of the table, took my knife and fork, and helped me to cut my chop. "Next year at this time, I want carpenters working on our house," she repeated. It was the same thing she'd said earlier, the same thing she'd saida hundred times. Returning to her chair, she warned, "I won't go on living in this place. If we don't have carpenters building our house next year, I'm setting a match to this dump." She rose to fetch the coffee pot. "There are plenty of people in this townwho own their own homes, and they don't make as much money as you do," she told Papa, pouring coffee into his cup, then into her own. &nbsp; <br><br>"What do I care what plenty of people do?" he asked, stirring cream into his coffee. &nbsp; <br><br>Mama set the pot on the stove with a bang. "I'm serious, Willie. I want a house." &nbsp; <br><br>I didn't understand Papa's not wanting a house. It wasn't the way he was raised, Mama would say. Grandpa and Grandma Erhardt lived in a nice house with a pair of walnut trees in the front yard. Not a fancy or big house, but nice. We lived in the traindepot, a few feet from the tracks. &nbsp; <br><br>Papa worked for the railroad. He was the clerk in the depot. He and the depot agent handled the coming and going of trains. They sold tickets and figured out routes and schedules for the passengers who were going far across the country. They accepted outgoingfreight, weighing it and toting up the charges, and they unloaded incoming freight, and delivered it, too, if the party couldn't come down to pick it up. They dealt with mail, and sent and received telegrams. They saw to it that tracks were cleared or switchedfor trains requiring a siding. It was a busy job. There was a passenger train heading east in the morning, one going west in the afternoon. At least two freight trains came through each day, though these usually came through after supper in the evening. &nbsp; <br><br>The trains were big and noisy and dirty, and they smelled of coal, but Mama and Papa and I all loved them, each for our own reasons. I really couldn't imagine not living beside the trains, but I wanted a room of my own, so I supported Mama's campaign fora house. &nbsp; <br><br>Upstairs above the depot, in an apartment reserved for the depot agent, lived Mr. Art Bigelow and his wife, May, a taciturn, childless couple much devoted to stamp collecting and knitting, respectively. &nbsp; <br><br>When Papa came to Harvester, there were no living quarters provided for the clerk and his family. There was, however, a large, empty room at the east end of the ground floor. Its only door opened directly onto the station platform. Mama, who was determinedto save money for a house, saw in this room our rent-free living quarters for the next few years. I was a baby then, but she told the story so often that I seemed to remember how it looked. &nbsp; A space twenty feet by twenty feet, with a fifteen-foot ceiling, it possessed three very tall, stern-looking windows, grimed with the smoke and steam of thousands of trains. The walls were of a narrow, vertical board, painted railway gray, and the floorswere dusty, unvarnished oak. In one wall was a cold-water faucet, but no sink or drain. It was difficult to imagine for what purpose the room had been designed, unless the railroad had at some point envisioned it as lay-over quarters for train crews or sectiongangs. Mama got in touch with the railroad company at once, negotiating a rent-free agreement for us to occupy this daunting, minimal housing. &nbsp; <br><br>Papa was daunted, not Mama. "There must be rooms over a store that we could move into," Papa suggested. &nbsp; <br><br>"If we live here," Mama pointed out, "we can save the rent money for a house of our own." &nbsp; <br><br>"There's no heat. What'll we do in the winter?" &nbsp;<br><br> "We'll have a coal stove put in. The railroad has lots of coal." &nbsp; <br><br>"And a bathroom? What about that?" &nbsp; <br><br>"We'll use the toilet off the waiting room. For baths we'll buy a big galvanized tub, and I'll heat water." &nbsp; <br><br>"There's no drain in this room. What'll we do with the water we run?" &nbsp; <br><br>"We'll carry it over beyond the tracks and dump it." &nbsp; <br><br>Mama had an argument for all of Papa's misgivings. He was stunned and displeased by her willingness to live "like hoboes." Mama, who had graduated from high school, whose parents had graduated from high school! (Papa had quit school after the tenth grade.) Mama who had grown up in a comfortable house in a town with paved streets and three railroads. How could such a woman insist that they live in this cold, empty room? And with a baby? In a few months, when the snow came flying, wouldn't she feel foolish comingto him to complain that she couldn't keep the place warm and that she was catching pneumonia hauling slop water across the tracks? Then he would have a good laugh. &nbsp; <br><br>But Mama didn't complain, not in the first years. We were going to save for a new house. In the meantime, she made the depot house as comfortable and attractive as her considerable ingenuity could manage. Linoleum in a tan and cream pattern covered thefloor. The walls were painted ivory. A carpenter came with lumber and panels called compoboard, or a name very much like that. &nbsp; <br><br>With the four-by-eight-foot sheets of compoboard, he built partitions, and created a bedroom, kitchen, and living room. There were no doors, just doorways, and since the sheets were only four by eight, there was a two-foot gap between the floor and the bottom of the partition, and a five-foot gap between the top of the partition and the ceiling. Mama said the gaps allowed heat from the stove in the living room to circulate. Still, a lot of heat got lost up near that fifteen-foot ceiling, and once the placegot cold, it took forever to heat it up again. &nbsp; <br><br>In the kitchen, which was the room with the faucet and the door to the outside, Mama had a sink installed, with a drain that went into a pail underneath. She sewed a pretty fabric skirt to hide the pail. As I grew into a child, emptying the pail&#x2014;pails,actually, as there were three of them&#x2014;became my responsibility, though Mama helped in the coldest weather. The bedroom held Mama and Papa's bed, a bureau, a wardrobe, and my crib. You had to walk sideways to move around the furniture. &nbsp; <br><br>But, despite its shortcomings, once he'd gotten over the embarrassment of living as we did, Papa grew accustomed to our cramped quarters, and he could see no reason to go to the expense and disruption of building a new house. Mama, on the other hand, grewincreasingly dissatisfied. &nbsp; <br><br>Clearing away dishes, she told Papa, "I went by the lumberyard this afternoon and got some more house plans I want you to look at." &nbsp; <br><br>Papa reached for the newspaper under his chair. &nbsp; <br><br>"Willie, I want you to look at them. We've got to get out of here. Lark can't go on sleeping in a crib. She's six years old. She needs a room of her own and a real bed. I've made as much of this place as I can, but I can't make it bigger." &nbsp; <br><br>Papa lowered the paper. "Where are you off to?" he asked, taking note of Mama's pin curls. &nbsp; <br><br>"Where am I off to! It's Friday. I'm off to bridge club. How many years have I been going to bridge club? You still have to ask." She poured boiling water from the tea kettle into the dishpan and added cold water from the faucet. "Lark, if you've finishedyour pie, would you give me a hand here? I'm going to have to shake a leg if I don't want to be late." &nbsp; <br><br>"Who's staying with the kid?" Papa asked. &nbsp; <br><br>"You," Mama told him impatiently, scrubbing an empty pie plate. &nbsp; <br><br>"No, I'm not." &nbsp; <br><br>"What do you mean?" she asked, turning without removing her hands from the dishwater. &nbsp; <br><br>"I've got a poker game." &nbsp; <br><br>Mama stared, disbelieving. &nbsp; <br><br>"Now don't start in," Papa told her. &nbsp; <br><br>"Don't tell me not to start in. How could you do this? And on a bridge night at that?" &nbsp; <br><br>"I forgot." &nbsp; <br><br>"You didn't forget. Since Lark was a baby, bridge club has been every other Friday." &nbsp; <br><br>"I forgot that this Friday was the 'other.' " &nbsp; <br><br>"You are a liar, Willie. You enjoy spoiling my good times." &nbsp; <br><br>"Well, get on the phone and get a high school kid to stay with her," Papa said. &nbsp; <br><br>"I will not. This is your fault. You get on the phone." &nbsp; <br><br>"I don't know their names. You're the one who knows them." He threw down the paper. "You damned well better get someone before you leave here." &nbsp; <br><br>"The hell I will," Mama retorted, shoving the clean skillet at me. &nbsp; <br><br>"Then take her with you." &nbsp; <br><br>"No. The girls all agreed we wouldn't bring our kids. If everyone brought one, it would be a madhouse. You knew you were supposed to stay with her tonight. You did this on purpose." &nbsp;<br><br> "For Christ's sake, Arlene, why would I forget on purpose?" &nbsp; <br><br>"Because you don't like the bridge club." She turned to face him, the dishcloth in her hand. "You never liked it." &nbsp; <br><br>"A bunch of cackling hens." A smile began to pull at one side of Papa's mouth, and he raised his empty coffee cup to hide it. &nbsp; <br><br>Mama burst into tears and hurled the wet dishcloth at him, striking the coffee cup and knocking it to the floor, where it shattered at his feet. &nbsp; <br><br>"It's just like our house that doesn't get built," she cried. "You sit there eating pie and smirking. Everything is a joke. All my plans," she choked, "are funny, aren't they?" &nbsp; <br><br>Papa was already out the door and heading down the platform to the depot office. Mama fell upon the dishcloth and flung it against the wall above the sink. "Goddamn him," she cried, "I'll show him."</p><h2>Quantum Mechanics for Chemists (Tutorial Chemistry Texts, Volume 14)</h2><p>Quantum Mechanics for Chemists is designed to provide chemistry undergraduates with a basic understanding of the principles of quantum mechanics. The text assumes some knowledge of chemical bonding and a familiarity with the qualitative aspects of molecular orbitals in molecules such as butadiene and benzene. Thus it is intended to follow a basic course in organic and/or inorganic chemistry. The approach is rather different from that adopted in most books on quantum chemistry in that the Schr�dinger wave equation is introduced at a fairly late stage, after students have become familiar with the application of de Broglie-type wavefunctions to free particles and particles in a box. Likewise, the Hamiltonian operator and the concept of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are not introduced until the last two chapters of the book, where approximate solutions to the wave equation for many-electron atoms and molecules are discussed. In this way, students receive a gradual introduction to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses. Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples.</p><p>Providing chemistry undergraduates with a basic understanding of the principles of quantum mechanics, this book is ideal to follow a basic course in organic and/or inorganic chemistry.

Each time series model is illustrated through practical applications addressing contemporary issues, and is defined in mathematical notation.</p></p><p><p>Yearly global mean temperature and ocean levels, daily share prices, and the signals transmitted back to Earth by the Voyager space craft are all examples of sequential observations over time known as time series. This book gives you a step-by-step introduction to analysing time series using the open source software R. Each time series model is motivated with practical applications, and is defined in mathematical notation. Once the model has been introduced it is used to generate synthetic data, using R code, and these generated data are then used to estimate its parameters. This sequence enhances understanding of both the time series model and the R function used to fit the model to data. Finally, the model is used to analyse observed data taken from a practical application. By using R, the whole procedure can be reproduced by the reader. All the data sets used in the book are available on the website http://staff.elena.aut.ac.nz/Paul-Cowpertwait/ts/.</p><p>The book is written for undergraduate students of mathematics, economics, business and finance, geography, engineering and related disciplines, and postgraduate students who may need to analyse time series as part of their taught programme or their research. </p><p>Paul Cowpertwait is an associate professor in mathematical sciences (analytics) at Auckland University of Technology with a substantial research record in both the theory and applications of time series and stochastic models.

In what ways do the violent histories of slavery and empire continue to influence the allocation of global resources? <br><br>Rethinking Racial Capitalism: Questions of Reproduction and Survival proposes a return to analyses of racial capitalism &#x2013; the capitalism that is inextricably linked with histories of racist expropriation &#x2013; and argues that it is only by tracking the interconnections between changing modes of capitalism and racism that we can hope to address the most urgent challenges of social injustice. It considers the continuing impact of global histories of racist expropriation on more recent articulations of capitalism, with a particular focus on the practices of racial capitalism, the continuing impact of uneven development, territory and border-marking, the place of reproductive labour in sustaining racial capitalism, the marketing of diversity as a consumer pleasure and the creation of supposedly 'surplus' populations.</p><p>Gargi Bhattacharyya is Professor of Sociology at the Centre For Migration, Refugees and Belonging, University of East London, UKFull of intellectual energy and wit, Rethinking Racial Capitalism is a fascinating account of the entanglements between capitalism and racism, from the proliferation of territorial borders, to reparations and indebtedness. Fulfilling her promise of descriptive analysis, Bhattacharyya&#x2019;s storytelling is rich, alert, vibrant. Capitalism&#x2019;s allure appears as a hot bath, a teenage outfit, the opening of a menu. I didn&#x2019;t want the book to end. (Yasmin Gunaratnam, Reader in Sociology at Goldsmiths University of London, UK)<br><br>To read Gargi Bhattacharyya is always enlightening: she teaches how to think, not just what to think; she engages her readers as citizens, not just professors; and she grounds her scholarship in movements for liberation. Rethinking Racial Capitalism will transform our understanding of one of the key issues of the day &#x2013; how capitalism and racism work together. (Arun Kundnani, New York University)<br><br>An acutely observed, innovative and thought-provoking study of the articulation of racism with the development of capitalism. Replete with intersectional insights, it extends contemporary debate through a feminist lens. Careful socio-economic and political analysis is complemented with attention to issues of affect such as the trans-generational carryover of trauma. An excellent combination of analytical rigour with political acumen and compassion. A must-read for anyone concerned about the effects of racial capitalism. (Avtar Brah, Professor Emerita of Sociology, Birkbeck College, University of London)<br><br>[Bhattacharyya] uses the concept of "racial capitalism" to understand how racism enables major aspects of capitalist forms of development [and] argues that the concepts on which racial capitalism is based can also be used to marginalize groups by gender identity, disability, and age.

In the West, traditional ways of mourning are disappearing, and although Western science has had a major impact on how people die, it has taught us little about the way to die or to grieve.

Shiner's text is scholarly but accessible, and should appeal to readers with even a dabbler's interest in art theory."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> <br> "<i>The Invention of Art</i> is enjoyable to read and provides a welcome addition to the history and philosophy of art."&#x2014;Terrie L. Wilson, <i>Art Documentation</i><br> <br> "A lucid book . . . it should be a must-read for anyone active in the arts."&#x2014;Marc Spiegler, <i>Chicago Tribune Books</i></p></p><p>We take enormous comfort in the notion that art began in ancient Greece, or maybe even the Renaissance, and that its progress can be traced through a long series of masterpieces. We believe even more firmly in the idea that art is transcendent and universal. With <i>The Invention of Art</i>, Larry Shiner challenges these articles of faith and invites us to reconsider the history of art entirely. He argues that the category of fine art is a modern invention-that the lines drawn between art and craft resulted from key social transformations in Europe during the long eighteenth century. <br>The idea of fine art was inextricably linked to the development of new market economies and the rise of the middle classes, both constituting enormous changes in Western culture. During this period, the art museum, a place where art could be viewed, digested, and contemplated, first came into being. Meanwhile, critics became less interested in how art and literature functioned, and more fascinated with art's aesthetic worth. At the same time, the performance of classical music shifted from places of worship and political ceremonies to more secular and commercial venues where it could be listened to silently. And accompanying these institutional changes was the dissolution of the patronage system for producing art and the advent of a new market system supported by consumers. <br><br><i>The Invention of Art</i> traces the rich tradition of opposition to these institutions. Shiner looks at works by thinkers as varied as Hogarth, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Emerson, Marx, Dewey, and Benjamin. Ultimately, he shows how the modern system maintains its dominance through the assimilation of artists and musicians who resist it, and the distinctions it draws between artists and artisans, and high art and the crafts.<b>Larry Shiner</b> is a professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois at Springfield.

Pierret is an advanced level presentation of the underlying functional formalism routinely used in describing the operational behavior of solid state devices. </p> <p> The second edition provides an update of the topic presentation, semiconductor parametric information, and relevant references throughout the volume. There is also a 50% increase in the end-of-chapter problems. Given the success of the first edition, the second edition retains the same overall material coverage and a pedagogical approach in introducing necessary concepts, models, and formalism. </p><p> <i>Advanced Semiconductor Fundamentals</i> is viewed by the author as a doorway to the graduate or journal-level discussion of solid-state devices. It was originally prepared in part as a supplement to a widely used graduate text and in part to provide background information required in advanced-level volumes of the Modular Series on Solid State Devices. Since its introduction in 1987, the volume has subsequently become routinely employed in introductory graduate-level courses on solid-state devices. The second edition primarily revises dated sections of the volume and, with a significant increase in end-of-chapter problems, expands its usefulness as a stand-alone text. </p> <p> The designation "advanced" used in the title of the volume is of course a relative term: the material in the volume is "advanced" relative to that in Modular Series Volume I and chapters one through three in <i>Semiconductor Device Fundamentals,</i> other works by the author. The cited works are recommended prerequisites for the present volume. The present volume extends and reinforces the concepts presented in the cited works. </p> <p> Following the general philosophy of the Modular Series, the present volume is devoted to a specific topic area and is essentially self-contained. The modular nature of the series permits the volumes to be used in courses of either standard or nonstandard format, the latter including short courses, television or web-based courses, and in-house continuing education courses. Students, practicing engineers, and scientists should also find this and the other volumes useful for individual instruction, whether it be for learning, reference, or review. Coherent presentation of the material in <i>Advanced Semiconductor Fundamentals</i> in the standard lecture format requires at least 15 fifty-minute periods. With minor deletions, the material in this volume is regularly covered during the first six weeks of a one-semester, three-credit-hour, first-year graduate-level course in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. </p> <p> The topic coverage in the second edition is essentially identical to that in the first edition. The treatment includes basic semiconductor properties, elements of Quantum Mechanics, energy band theory, equilibrium carrier statistics, recombination-generation processes, and drift/diffusion carrier transport. Unfortunately, length limitations precluded coverage of a number of other desirable topics. Nevertheless, the coverage should be sufficient for understanding or delving deeper into the operation of the major semiconductor device structures. Of the many semiconductors, silicon (Si) totally dominates the present marketplace; the vast majority of discrete devices and integrated circuits are silicon based. Given its position of dominance, attention is focused herein on Si in the text development. Where feasible, however, GaAs and other semiconductors are featured as the discussion warrants. </p> <p> It should be mentioned that throughout the volume every effort has been made to use normally encountered symbols for a given quantity. In some instances this has led to dual-meaning symbols (e.g., <i>k</i> for wavenumber and for the Boltzmann constant). The proper interpretation of a dual-meaning symbol is invariably obvious from context. In the author's opinion it is preferable to court ambiguity rather than introduce alternative symbols and/or cumbersome subscripts that are unlikely to be encountered in other works. </p> <p> Finally, I would like to acknowledge the influence of the classic text by McKelvey (J. P McKelvey, <i>Solid State and Semiconductor Physics,</i> Harper and Row, New York, 1966). Chapter 2 and portions of Chapter 3 parallel McKelvey's organization and/or topic presentation. I would also like to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Prof. Mark Lundstrom, a Purdue University colleague, who was most helpful in supplying key information on several topics and Tom Robbins, ECE Publisher at Prentice Hall, who exhibited great patience in dealing with a difficult author. </p> <p> Prof. Robert F.

Ronald L. Grimes shows that this debate has stagnated, due in part to a manner of theorizing too far removed from the study of actual religious practices. A worthwhile theory, according to Grimes, must be practice-oriented, and practices are most effectively studied by field research methods.<br><br><em>The Craft of Ritual Studies</em> melds together a systematic theory and method capable of underwriting the cross-cultural, interdisciplinary study of ritual. Grimes exposes the limitations that disable many theories of ritual--for example, defining ritual as essentially religious, assuming that ritual's only function is to generate group solidarity, or treating ritual as a mirror of the status quo. He provides a guide for fieldwork on complex ritual events, particularly those characterized by social conflict or cultural creativity. The volume includes a case study, focusing on a single complex event: the Santa Fe Fiesta, a New Mexico celebration marked by protracted ethnic conflict and ongoing dramatic creativity. Grimes develops such themes as the relation of ritual to media, theater, and film, the dynamics of ritual creativity, the negotiation of ritual criticism, and the impact of ritual on cultural and physical environments.<br><br>This important book, the capstone work of Grimes's three decades of leadership in the field of ritual studies, is accompanied by a set of online videos, as well as appendices illustrating key aspects of ritual studies.<br></p><p>&#34;To say that Ronald Grimes is a major figure is an understatement. His books-this the latest of them-are witness to his accomplishment as an original thinker. This book is a culminating effort that will invigorate the field.&#34; --Richard Schechner, Professor of Performance Studies, New York UniversityRonald L.

In addition, the book fully acknowledges the important role of high-speed computers in aerodynamics.<br>After a short review of the fundamentals of fluid mechanics, the authors offer a fairly extensive treatment of constant-density inviscid flow.

The&nbsp;Crossway Classic Commentaries series, carefully adapted for maximum understanding and usefulness, presents the very best work on individual Bible books for today's believers.</p><p>The author of Hebrews wanted his audience to know and understand one truth: Christ is superior, and therefore, so is Christianity. He demonstrates this by comparing the imperfect old covenant with the perfect new covenant. The person of Christ is better than prophets and angels, His priesthood is greater than that of Melchizedek and the line of Aaron, and His power within the believer's life is incomparable. Between these contrasts he exhorts the readers to persevere in their faith, be obedient, grow in their understanding, and not miss the grace of God. The lessons and admonitions of Hebrews have intensely practical application for all readers&#x2015;then and now.</p><p>John Owens' unveiling of this text will give pastors and students of the Bible a thorough handle on its key passages.

Jenson is rebellious and full of attitude and he kicks off at anything, constantly winding Georgie up. Georgie doesn&#x2019;t cope well with change and is soon in a permanent state of stress.

Inspector Erlendur's investigation takes him back to the Cold War era, when bright, left-wing students in Iceland were sent to study in the "heavenly state" of Communist East Germany. Teeming with spies and informants, though, their "heavenly state" becomes a nightmare of betrayal and murder. Brilliantly weaving international espionage and a chilling cold case investigation, <i>The Draining Lake </i>is Arnaldur Indridason at his best.</p></p><p><p><b>ARNALDUR INDRI�ASON </b>won the Glass Key award for Best Nordic Crime Novel for both <i>Jar City </i>and <i>Silence of the Grave</i>. He lives in Reykjav�k.</p>At the start of Gold Dagger Award&#x2013;winner Indridason's carefully plotted fourth entry in his crime series starring detective Erlendur Sveinsson (<i>Jar City</i>, etc.), a human skeleton surfaces in the bed of a lake near Reykjavik that's been mysteriously draining away. The bones are tied to some kind of Russian listening device, presumably a remnant of the Cold War. As Erlendur and his colleagues, Elinborg and Sigurdur Oli, go about checking on people who went missing around 1970, Erlendur is reminded of the disappearance of his younger brother when they were children. Erlendur's lifelong obsession with the missing provides a haunting metaphor for this lonely, middle-aged man, divorced and alienated from his own two children. Elinborg and Sigurdur Oli, on the other hand, aren't particularly persuasive characters, but flashbacks to the University of Leipzig during the Cold War provide compelling insights into the splintered politics of the day, as well as the Icelandic students studying there at the time. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her story is raw like that first bite of wild onion, alive with startling imagery, and told with uncommon emotional power.<br><br>Regan grew up the youngest of four headstrong girls on a small farm in Northwest Indiana. While gathering raspberries as a toddler, Regan preternaturally understood to pick just the ripe fruit and leave the rest for another day. In the family&#x2019;s leaf-strewn fields, the orange flutes of chanterelles beckoned her while they eluded others.<br><br>Regan has had this intense, almost otherworldly connection with food and the earth it comes from since her childhood, but connecting with people has always been more difficult. She was a little girl who longed to be a boy, gay in an intolerant community, an alcoholic before she turned twenty, and a woman in an industry dominated by men&#x2014;she often felt she &#x201c;wasn&#x2019;t made for this world,&#x201d; and as far as she could tell, the world tended to agree. But as she learned to cook in her childhood farmhouse, got her first restaurant job at age fifteen, taught herself cutting-edge cuisine while running a &#x201c;new gatherer&#x201d; underground supper club, and worked her way from front-of-house staff to running her own kitchen, Regan found that food could help her navigate the strangeness of the world around her.<br><br>Regan cooks with instinct, memory, and an emotional connection to her ingredients that can&#x2019;t be taught. Written from that same place of instinct and emotion, <i>Burn the Place</i> tells Regan&#x2019;s story in raw and vivid prose and brings readers into a world&#x2014;from the Indiana woods to elite Chicago kitchens&#x2014;that is entirely original and unforgettable.</p><p><b>Iliana Regan</b> is a self-taught chef.

She is self-taught, charismatic, delightfully foul-mouthed, and utterly devoid of pretension as she parallels her ascent in the culinary world with a past strewn with AA chips, jail cell stints, and brutal family losses. This groundbreaking memoir reinvents the well-worn trope of the &#x201c;bad boy&#x201d; superstar chef, presenting us instead with a palpably vulnerable, complicatedly feminist, and sexy-queer-girl genius who takes no prisoners, including herself. Regan&#x2019;s wild rags-to-Michelin story has appeal far beyond the &#x201c;foodie&#x201d; market, particularly among those hungry for tales of unapologetic women who have made it entirely on their own terms.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Gina Frangello, author of <i>A Life in Men and Every Kind of Wanting</i></b></p><h2>Nothing Daunted: Isobel Kuhn</h2><p>Up and up they followed the trail....

Through one of those dark gorges flowed the Salweek River, and by its side lived the Lisu people. <p>In 1922 Isobel Miller was a senior at the University of British Columbia--beautiful, talented, popular--and so miserable that she wanted to die. In her despair she began a search that was to last a lifetime: the search to know God. </p><p>Her investigation led to the Bible and to Jesus Christ, and one day God gave her the desire to share what she had learned with the Lisu tribe in southwest China. Ten years passed before Isobel and her husband were finally sent to the Lisu's mountain wilderness. She grew to love the people dearly, and in her adventurous life she experienced the challenges of pioneer living, the perils of war, and the joys of proving the faithfulness of God.</p></p><p>An editor once asked Mrs. Repp to write a flashcard story about her favorite missionary, and the choice was not hard to make. As a teen-ager she had cherished Isobel Kuhn's book By Searching, and like Isobel Kuhn, she had grown up in Vancouver, British Columbia, and attended a school in Chicago. As she studied Mrs. Kuhn's other books, she found them so fascinating that she decided to write a full-length book about the missionary's life and work. <p>Gloria Repp has written several books and short stories for children.

Ten-year-old Mamie's class is given an assignment to write letters to the astronauts. All the girls write to Neil Armstrong ("So cute!") and all the boys write to Buzz Aldrin ("So cool!"). Only Mamie writes to Michael Collins, the astronaut who will come so close but never achieve everyone else's dream of walking on the moon, because he is the one who must stay with the ship. After school ends, Mamie keeps writing to Michael Collins, taking comfort in telling someone about what's going on with her family as, one by one, they leave the house thinking that someone else is taking care of her&#x2015;until she is all alone except for her cat and her best friend, Buster. And as the date of the launch nears, Mamie can't help but wonder: <i>Does no one stay with the ship anymore? </i>With I LOVE YOU, MICHAEL COLLINS, Lauren Baratz-Logsted has created a heartwarming story about family and being true to yourself.<br><b>A Margaret Ferguson Book</b></p><p>Lauren Baratz-Logsted is the author of over 25 books for adults, teens and children, including the popular nine-book series <i>The Sisters 8</i>, which she created with her husband and daughter. Before becoming a writer, Lauren was an independent bookseller, <i>Publishers Weekly</i> reviewer, freelance editor, sort-of librarian, and window washer. She lives in Danbury, Connecticut, with her family and their cat, Yoyo. She still remembers watching the astronauts land on the moon.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;In the summer of 1969, NASA prepares to send Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon while 10-year-old Mamie writes letters to Michael Collins, Apollo 11's pilot. When Mamie's mother, an unsatisfied housewife, leaves home, Mamie's father follows, and the girl's support network disintegrates until she is home alone. Mamie hides this fact as she and her best friend Buster research Apollo 11, preparing their own neighborhood celebrations. Space launch drama mirrors Mamie's personal upheaval, her feelings swinging wildly between despair and joy. As Mamie's family members gingerly reconnect, she ties the space launch to her own experiences. Baratz-Logsted pens a quiet gem bubbling with unexpected turmoil. The epistolary format gives Mamie a vehicle to cope with crisis; the letters reveal her to be resourceful and contemplative without sounding stilted or unsympathetic. She writes short, direct sentences that feel childlike yet profound. Throughout the novel, Baratz-Logsted addresses gender roles with a light hand. In Mamie's class, "all the boys [say] they [want] to be astronauts." Then one girl says, "I want to marry an astronaut." The other girls follow suit, but not Mamie. Mamie's mother and older sister Eleanor also explore nontraditional female roles in 1960s society. Mamie's family members&#x2014;even when fighting&#x2014;don't waste words on emotion. This phlegmatic attitude steers the work away from Greek tragedy and makes the rare moments of love resonate more strongly. VERDICT Mamie's story cleverly shifts focus from macro to micro events in ways that children and educators will enjoy. Recommended for all libraries serving middle grade readers.&#x2014;Caitlin Augusta, Stratford Library Association, CT</p><h2>Blood Passion: The Ludlow Massacre and Class War in the American West, First Paperback Edition</h2><p><p>By early April 1914, Colorado Governor Elias Ammons thought the violence in his state&#x2019;s strike-bound southern coal district had eased enough that he could begin withdrawing the Colorado National Guard, deployed six months earlier as military occupiers. But Ammons misread the signals, and on April 20, 1914, a full-scale battle erupted between the remaining militiamen and armed strikers living in a tent colony at the small railroad town of Ludlow. Eight men were killed in the fighting, which culminated in the burning of the colony. The next day, the bodies of two women and eleven children were found suffocated in a below-ground shelter. The &#x201c;Ludlow Massacre,&#x201d; as it quickly became known, launched a national call-to-arms for union supporters to join a ten-day guerrilla war along more than two hundred miles of the eastern Rockies. The convulsion of arson and violence killed more than thirty people and didn&#x2019;t end until President Woodrow Wilson sent in the U.S. Army. Overall at least seventy-five men, women, and children were killed in seven months, likely the nation&#x2019;s deadliest labor struggle.<br><br>In <i>Blood Passion,</i> journalist Scott Martelle explores this little-noted tale of political corruption and repression and immigrants&#x2019; struggles against dominant social codes of race, ethnicity, and class. More than a simple labor dispute, the events surrounding Ludlow embraced some of the most volatile social movements of the early twentieth century, pitting labor activists, socialists, and anarchists against the era&#x2019;s powerful business class, including John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and helped give rise to the modern twins of corporate public relations and political &#x201c;spin.&#x201d; But at its heart, <i>Blood Passion</i> is the dramatic story of small lives merging into a movement for change and of the human struggle for freedom and dignity.</p></p><p>"<i>Blood Passion</i> is the definitive account of a major landmark in the American struggle for social justice. And the way Scott Martelle tells the story is splendid proof that history can both be written as vividly as a novel and also be documented with scrupulous care." - <b>Adam Hochschild</b>, author of <i>Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves</i> <p>"We must welcome this carefully-researched study of one of the most dramatic, violent, and important episodes in the history of labor struggles in this country." - <b>Howard Zinn</b>, author of <i>A People's History of the United States</i></p>A few years back I encountered a footnote reference in a book to upwards of 100 men, women and children killed in a months-long war between striking coal miners and the Colorado National Guard. My first thought: Why didn't I know that? I knew about the April 1914 Ludlow Massacre, when two mothers and 11 children died after marauding Guardsmen torched a strikers' tent colony. But the broader war came as a revelation (the death toll was closer to 75). It was telling that such a protracted showdown between capital and labor had been reduced to a literal footnote. History is written by the victors, and labor has not been victorious very often. Curiosity drove me deeper into the history, and it quickly became apparent there was more here than a single newspaper or magazine article. <i>Blood Passion</i> is the result. <p>Although <i>Blood Passion</i> explores the violent trajectory of a labor strike, it is not a work of labor history. Rather, it is a journalist's take on a story of oppression and rebellion, of ordinary people revolting under a corrupt political and economic system, and of immigrants who discovered that they had to fight for their bit of the American Dream. From this country's earliest days, we have wrestled with the conflicting concepts of respecting our government and rebelling against it. Blood Passion is an attempt to knock some of the dust off this long-forgotten yet hugely emblematic moment in American history.</p></p><h2>How to Pray</h2><p><i>Prayer is not an occasional exercise to which you turn now and then; it is a life attitude.

Any understanding of America as a nation of spiritual values will in the years ahead require Needleman's work as a point of reference.</p></p><p>The acclaimed author of <i>The American Soul</i>, <i>Why Can&#x2019;t We Be Good?</i> and <i>Money and the Meaning of Life</i>, Jacob Needleman is Professor of Philosophy at San Francisco State University, and former Director of the Center for the Study of New Religions at the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley. He lives in Oakland, CA.Jacob Needleman examines a number of historical figures and situations for the insight they provide into the American character. Some, like Washington at Valley Forge or Lincoln and the Civil War, are well known; others less so. In all cases, Needleman's clear, impassioned voice guides us, now explaining, now calling for ethical rejuvenation. When Needleman speaks, he inspires. His pace is masterful, smoothly blending pauses for emphasis and complexity. However, the choice to include actors as the voices of the historical figures quoted doesn't work well. The shift in voices breaks the mood, and none of the actors master the cadences (or regional accents) of skilled orators such as Frederick Douglass.

The Art and Life of Roy Lichtenstein</h2><p><i>The life of the great Pop Art painter Roy Lichtenstein, illustrated with his most famous artworks.</i><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>In the newest of Abrams&#x2019; award-winning line of picture book biographies of artists, Susan Goldman Rubin evocatively explores Roy Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work and life and his groundbreaking influence on the art world. In Roy&#x2019;s long career as a teacher, artist, and innovator, he changed the way that people thought about art and how artists thought about their subjects, challenging people to see familiar sights with new eyes.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>Classically trained in painting and drawing, Roy found inspiration from cartoons, newspaper comics, and children&#x2019;s books&#x2015;images most people didn&#x2019;t consider &#x201c;serious&#x201d; art. He also chose to paint, in meticulous detail, the building blocks of painting&#x2015;a single brushstroke or the back of a canvas&#x2015;drawing attention to the way that artists use these tools. Roy and the other Pop Artists, including Andy Warhol, broke down the rules about what makes proper subjects for fine art. In over a thousand paintings and numerous other works, Roy brought familiar images into new light and captured the imagination of the world. The book includes a bibliography, an index, and a list of museums where you can see Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work.<p></p></p><p>Susan Goldman Rubin has written a number of books for young readers, including <i>Andy Warhol: Pop Art Painter</i>; <i>L&#x2019;Chaim! To Jewish Life in America</i>; <i>Searching for Anne Frank</i>; <i>Margaret Bourke-White</i>, an ALA Best Book for Young Adults; and <i>Steven Spielberg: Crazy for Movies</i>, named one of the New York Public Library&#x2019;s Best Books for the Teen Age. She lives in Malibu, California.<br><br><p></p>Grade 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;Bold and graphic, with an attractive design, this title will appeal to budding artists and comic-book fans. The reproductions of Lichtenstein's work are large format, in full color, and provide eye candy for kids who aren't interested in reading the text. Cleverly inserted in between Lichtenstein's pieces are reproductions of the classic and comic-book art that inspired him, such as Henri Matisse's <i>The Red Studio</i> and even advertisements for shoes. Lichtenstein is known for his paintings inspired by comic books, but Rubin does an excellent job of mentioning his other work, such as his sculptures and landscape art. The insightful quotes and most of the references to his personal life serve only to explain how his art evolved or how he came to be in a particular place in the world. This approach is effective because the star here is the art and the process. The text (a bold typewriter font) is simple but descriptive and compelling. Lichtenstein's signature Benday dots appear in all of the page margins; even the page numbers are enclosed in circles. The back matter is exceptional as well, with a thorough glossary and index and an expansive list of additional resources. The thoughtful design and content show that the author truly had young people in mind while making this book.&#x2014;<i>Laura Lutz, Queens Borough Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Everyone, including Starr himself, believed that he was beyond rehabilitation and without hope in this world. Then, like the poet once said, he was &#x201c;touched by the Master&#x2019;s hand.&#x201d; Where HATE had once been the driving force of his life, now LOVE ruled. The love of God changed Starr Daily; and as he learned to walk in that love, he changed his circumstances, the people around him, the prison institution, and the course of his life. Love Can Open Prison Doors does more than tell the story of how one man was changed by God&#x2019;s love. It opens the eyes of the reader to the limitless possibilities of what love can do.</p><p>In the early 1900s, Starr Daily was a hardened criminal, the kind of man who seemed destined to spend his life behind bars. Filled with hate from the tender age of eight years old, Starr had already run afoul of the law repeatedly by the time he reached adolescence. Uncaring and calloused to the suffering of others, Daily admits that he &#x201c;...harmed thousands, many very brutally.&#x201d; Daily became a hardened criminal, and spent fourteen years in prisons and chain gangs, surviving the barbaric penal system of the early 20th century by the force of his hatred. Everyone, including Starr himself, believed that he was beyond rehabilitation and without hope in this world. The world may have given up on Starr Daily, and Starr may have given up on himself. Yet, while no person on earth found him worth saving, in a phenomenal manner, Starr met his Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. The love of God changed Starr Daily; and as he learned to walk in that love, he changed his circumstances, the people around him, the prison institution, and the course of his life.</p><h2>Cast in Honor (The Chronicles of Elantra, 12)</h2><p><em>In the aftermath of a vicious battle between darkness and light, the city of Elantra has emerged victorious. But Shadows continue to haunt every corner of its streets...</em><em>&nbsp;</em><br><br>Elantra stands strong, but countless numbers of Hawks, the city's staunchest protectors, were lost in the brutal attack.

Called in to investigate a triple murder in a quiet part of town, Kaylin and her companions are soon embroiled in a case that is anything but routine. Evidence of the deadly Shadows that still threaten the city leads to hints of ancient, forgotten magics...and everything can be traced directly to Ravellon, the heart of the Shadows and the darkness they contain.&nbsp;<br><br>But it is there that Lord Nightshade will be found&#x2014;if he still survives.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Michelle Sagara writes as both Michelle Sagara and Michelle West; she is also published as Michelle Sagara West.

But to Kaylin, it had been a nightmare&#x2014;one that she'd finally escaped. The Palace Guard no longer lined the halls outside of her room, and her rooms were no longer so grand or so fine that she felt as if she didn't belong in them. The shutters on her windows&#x2014;and they were shuttered, not barred&#x2014;weren't as warped as they had been in her old apartment, but the windows opened to let both light and air in, when she desired it.<br><br>And best of all: Dragon arguments no longer woke her out of a sound sleep.<br><br>In theory, Barrani arguments were quieter than draconic arguments, Barrani throats being confined to the general shape and size, even if they were immortal. Angry Barrani weren't exactly <i>safer</i> to be around, but at least they didn't demand attention half a city block away.<br><br>So much for theory.<br><br>The Barrani engaged in this particular argument were in the same building. Their shouts shook the floor, which shook her bed, which caused Kaylin to sit up and scrabble under her pillow for the dagger she always slept with.<br><br>Her small dragon familiar, usually a floppy and relatively inert mass somewhere at the top of her pillow, hissed. It was dark enough&#x2014;barely&#x2014;that she could feel him more than see him.<br><br>In response to the stray thought, a soft glow lit the interior of the room. This was a standard feature of living in an intelligent and responsive building, but three weeks in, Kaylin still found it a bit creepy.<br><br>"I'm sorry, Kaylin," Helen said, although she didn't dim the lights. "It's habit. Generally when people are worried about visibility, it's because they might injure themselves in the darkness." She was, of course, nowhere to be seen&#x2014;or, conversely, <i>everywhere,</i> as she <i>was</i> the building.<br><br>Guilt, of course, came on the heels of light. Kaylin wasn't used to guarding her thoughts. She could (mostly) keep the bad ones firmly sealed behind her teeth, but Helen didn't require the spoken word. Then again, Helen didn't seem to judge or take offense at the unspoken word, which was definitely for the best.<br><br>The floor shook again, and this time, Barrani words were clearly audible. There were, as expected, two voices, crashing into each other: Mandoran's and Annarion's.<br><br>"What exactly are they doing?" Kaylin swiveled to dump her feet off the side of her bed. The mattress was dense and thick, but it was not&#x2014;like palace mattresses&#x2014;three feet off the ground.<br><br>"Disagreeing."<br><br>"Sorry, I got that part. What are they disagreeing about?" Mandoran switched, midsentence, to the Elantran that was Kaylin's mother tongue.<br><br>"You can't hear them?"<br><br>"I heard the last bit, and you should tell Mandoran that what he's suggesting is anatomically impossible." She walked to the chair nearest the actual closet and retrieved the clothing she'd be wearing, bar disaster, to the office today. The small dragon showed his appreciation for being rudely woken by taking off with the stick she used to keep her hair off her neck and face. He also squawked a lot.<br><br>"Mandoran says," Helen finally replied, "that it's not anatomically impossible for them. Annarion says&#x2014;"<br><br>"Yes, thanks, I heard his response. Have they let up at all in the past four days?"<br><br>"They haven't been shouting at each other&#x2014;"<br><br>"I mean, have they taken <i>any</i> breaks?"<br><br>"No, dear."<br><br>"It's probably a miracle they're both still alive."<br><br>"Mandoran agrees. He apologizes and says they will take a break now, and resume practice once you've headed into the office."<br><br>In the three weeks since their narrow defeat of the ancestors, Annarion had not emerged from wherever he was training. Kaylin didn't expect that he would until Helen believed that his self-containment was complete enough to walk the city streets without immediately attracting every Shadow in the heart of the fiefs&#x2014;or worse.<br><br>He'd already done that once, though unintentionally. Helen insisted that Annarion had been shouting for attention&#x2014;for want of a better description&#x2014;and the ancestors had heard him. Since Kaylin had been standing beside the young Barrani for most of his stay in Elantra, she sympathized with his confusion: she certainly hadn't heard&#x2014;or seen&#x2014;anything that demanded attention. Nothing beyond his striking Barrani looks, at any rate.<br><br>But...the Shadows <i>had</i> come, leaving the containment of the fiefs and venturing into the streets of Elantra proper. And they'd made a beeline to Annarion. They weren't particularly careful about anything standing in their way, especially once they turned their attention to the Barrani High Halls. At that point, the Barrani and the Dragon Court had arrived in force.<br><br>The city had mostly recovered, although the streets in the high-rent district were no longer flat; the stone had been melted, and the creatures that had done the melting had left marks in the road when it once again solidified.<br><br>Helen was attempting to teach Annarion to be <i>quiet.</i> For some reason, Annarion did not take as well to these lessons as Mandoran had done. Mandoran joined Kaylin from time to time; Kaylin suspected that he did it just to annoy Annarion.<br><br>Then again, Annarion was desperately worried for his brother, Lord Nightshade. Nightshade's abrupt disappearance from his fief&#x2014;&#x2014;and, more important, his Castle&#x2014;weighed heavily on his younger brother, who suspected that his presence was the cause of Nightshade's absence. Kaylin privately agreed, but she didn't blame Annarion.<br><br>She blamed herself. She shouldn't have let Annarion visit his brother in Castle Nightshade. She shouldn't have let him out into the city at all until she was certain he wasn't a danger to others.<br><br><i>And you would have stopped him how, exactly?</i><br><br>Rationally, she was not responsible for anything that had occurred within Elantra. But as hers had been the hand that had rescued Annarion and the rest of his cohort from their jail in the heart of the green, her guilt had clear and undeniable roots. Kaylin attempted to push aside the feelings of remorse&#x2014;they pissed Teela off when she was in the office, and while Teela couldn't actually read minds, her familiarity with Kaylin's moods made her intuition pretty much the same in practical terms.<br><br>The sounds of shouting that would have contained nothing but curse words in most languages diminished as Kaylin made her way out of her room.<br><br>* * *<br><br>The halls in her new home were in far finer repair than the halls in her first home had been. Doors lined the walls&#x2014;doors behind which some of her friends now lived. Those friends were seldom in their own rooms, with a single notable exception: Bellusdeo. Her sole guard, Maggaron, had spent two weeks standing in the hall outside of the Dragon's doors; he took breaks for food, but they were short and silent.<br><br>Mandoran and Annarion spent their days&#x2014;and nights&#x2014;in what Helen referred to as the training room. It wasn't, as far as Kaylin could tell, actually a room in the strictest sense of the word. Teela&#x2014;the reason that Kaylin had attempted to even find it&#x2014;didn't consider it a room in the loosest sense of the word, either. Kaylin pointed out that it had a door.<br><br>Teela in turn pointed out that Helen&#x2014;whose voice was present&#x2014;had had trouble giving the two Hawks necessary directions to reach it; in Teela's opinion, the door had only been created as a visible marker. Helen confirmed this.<br><br>Regardless, although the two not-quite-Barrani boys had rooms of their own, they'd been holed up in a part of the mansion that couldn't be considered home, Maggaron had been standing or slumping against a wall in the hall, and Bellusdeo had treated her room like an impregnable fortress. As house-warmings went&#x2014;and Kaylin had only attended one, at Cait-lin's insistence&#x2014;it was unsuccessful.<br><br>Kaylin, however, had felt at home in her room from the moment she crossed its threshold.<br><br>She felt at home in the dining room, even though it was large; she felt at home entering the front door, even though it opened to a foyer with multiple levels and too much light; she was even becoming more comfortable with Helen's habit of treating her thoughts as questions, and answering them out loud. Tara, the Avatar of Tiamaris's Tower, did the same. It was hard to feel lonely in this house. If it was also hard to be alone&#x2014;and it was&#x2014;Kaylin didn't mind. Helen didn't judge her thoughts, her moods or her achievements&#x2014;or, more specifically, their lack.<br><br>"I would," Helen said, as Kaylin made her way to the dining room. "But thoughts are not actions; they're not <i>plans.</i> If you were planning something unwise, I would tell you." This was demonstrably true. "If you were planning something unethical, I would also tell you. I have lived with tenants who have chosen to act against their own beliefs&#x2014;and the results were not pleasant."<br><br>"They messed up?"<br><br>"Ah, no, dear. I have had a number of tenants since Hazielle. It is almost universally true that what you cannot bring yourself to do&#x2014;or perhaps to avoid doing&#x2014;you cannot believe anyone else would avoid. For instance: if you decry lying, but then do it yourself&#x2014;and not in the way manners might dictate&#x2014;you quickly assume that no one is honest. If you betray a trust for your own benefit, you assume that no one is trustworthy.<br><br>"This eventually causes a spiral of ugliness and loathing. The reason I would stop you from doing something you despise is not necessarily because I would despise it. It is because of the effect it would have, in the end, on the way you view and interact with the important parts of your world. If you have no self-respect, your ability to respect anything or anyone else is in peril."<br><br>Kaylin thought about this as she ate.<br><br>Mandoran soon joined her, looking glum and exhausted. Had he been mortal, she would have attempted to send him back to bed. Since he wasn't, and given that he was up against the wall of Annarion's frantic fear for his brother's safety, she decided against it.<br><br>"He's going to be the definition of anti-fun until we find his brother. I've taken quite a personal dislike to Lord Nightshade." He pushed food around his plate as if the eggs were unappetizing. "If it weren't for his brother, we could try to learn to be 'quiet' at a reasonable pace. The way things stand now, Annarion might as well be mortal."<br><br>"And you mean that in the nicest possible way, of course," Kaylin replied.<br><br>"Not really." Being on the receiving end of Kaylin's glare, he glanced at Helen; her Avatar had been waiting, more or less patiently, in the dining room. She appeared entirely unruffled by his comment.<br><br>"Look, I understand why mortals are in a rush about everything&#x2014;they get old and weak so quickly that they can't afford to take their time. We're not mortal. We have time."<br><br>"We don't know what happened to Nightshade."<br><br>"We know he isn't dead."<br><br>"There are worse things than death."<br><br>"One of which would be practicing with Annarion," Mandoran replied. Wincing, he added, "Great. Now he's angry."<br><br>Kaylin was on Annarion's side this time, but said nothing; the Hawks had taught her to leave Barrani arguments between the Barrani who were having them.<br><br>Thanks to Annarion and Mandoran's not exactly silent disagreement, Kaylin was in no danger of being late for work. The midwives had called her out twice during the past three weeks; they'd sent a runner to the house each time. So far, Helen seemed unwilling to install active mirrors in the manse. Mirrors were modern necessities. Anyone of import used them to communicate, <i>especially</i> in emergencies. Since Kaylin was feeling surprisingly awake despite the hour, she turned to Helen to tackle the subject for a third time.<br><br>"I need some sort of working mirror connection somewhere in the house. It doesn't have to be everywhere. It could be in one room. Or even only in mine. Marcus mirrors whenever he needs someone to shout at, and the midwives' guild mirrors when there's an emergency. So does the Foundling Hall. I can't ask the midwives' guild to send a runner between the endangered mother and this house and expect me to make it there in time. So far I've been lucky, but I doubt that will last."<br><br>Helen's expression flattened. There was a reason this was the third attempt at discussion. "I have made some inquiries about the mirror network; they are incomplete thus far. I am perhaps remiss; I do not wish to insult either you or the people for whom you work. But the mirror network is <i>not</i> secure. I am almost certain such forms of communication would not have been allowed in my youth."<br><br>"Almost everyone has some sort of mirror access." Everyone, Kaylin thought, who could afford it. She hadn't had a mirror when she'd lived in the fiefs. She hadn't daydreamed about having one, either&#x2014;she hadn't really been aware of their existence until she'd crossed the bridge. "Some people&#x2014;mostly Barrani&#x2014;have even set the mirror network to follow <i>them</i> when they move from place to place. And if the Barrani are willing to use it, how dangerous can it be?"<br><br>"There are many things the Barrani do&#x2014;and have done in the past&#x2014;that you would consider neither safe nor respectable." Helen sighed. "Understand that the mirror network is a magical lattice that underlays the city."<br><br>Kaylin nodded.<br><br>"At the moment, it is a magic that I do not permit across my boundaries. It appears to have been designed to travel around areas of non-cooperation; it therefore skirts the edge of my containments. I have not disrupted it in any fashion&#x2014;it did not seem to be directly harmful. If you wish to have access to your mirror network, I would have to alter my protections to allow the grid's magic to overlap my own, at least in part. I do not know who, or what, is responsible for the stability of the grid; I do not know who, or what, created the spells that contain it; nor do I fully understand the magic that sustains it."<br><br>"Don't do it," Mandoran said.<br><br>Kaylin glared at him. "Why not?"<br><br>"You don't let stray magic into the heart of your home."<br><br>"Everyone else does."<br><br>"So I'd gathered." He winced. "Teela's in a mood, by the way." Great.<br><br>"I don't know what kind of power your people have&#x2014;I have to assume it's not significant." Big surprise.<br><br>"But someone with significant power could transmit or feed an entirely different kind of magic through the lattice on which the mirror network is built."<br><br>"I'd think the Emperor would have something to say about that&#x2014;mirrors function in the Palace."<br><br>"Dragons aren't as fragile as mortals, for one. Look&#x2014;I'm not an Arcanist. There are no doubt some protections built into the mirror network to prevent its use as a weapon. I can imagine those protections being successful in most cases&#x2014;but not all. Magic is not precise; it's not entirely predictable&#x2014;as you should well know.<br><br>"But the possibility of being used as a weapon is not the only threat the mirrors might pose. It's highly likely that they could transmit private information to outside observers." His expression darkening, he added, "I mean&#x2014;Teela lets the damn network follow her."</p><h2>Trap with a Green Fence: Survival in Treblinka</h2><p><i>Trap with a Green Fence</i> is Richard Glazar's memoir of deportation, escape, and survival. In economical prose, Glazar weaves a description of Treblinka and its operations into his evocation of himself and his fellow prisoners as denizens of an underworld. Glazar gives us compelling images of these horrors in a tone that remains thoughtful but sober, affecting but simple.<br></p><p>This book is the author&#39;s memoir of his deportation from Prague to Treblinka, his ten-month conscription as a &#39;work Jew&#39; at the camp, his escape during the uprising of 1943, and his survival of the war as a foreign worker in Nazi Germany. This powerful document appears for the first time in English in Roslyn Theobald&#39;s fluid translation.<p>Richard Glazar (November 29, 1920 &#x2013; December 20, 1997, born Richard Goldschmid) was a Czech Jew who lived through World War II, one of only a few survivors of the Treblinka death camp. He portrayed the horror of Treblinka to the world in his book Trap with a Green Fence.</p></p><h2>With These Hands: Stories</h2><p>The timeless fiction of Louis L'Amour is both unforgettable and undeniably American, deftly capturing the heroic bravery and intrepid spirit that make this nation great. L&#x2019;Amour &#x2019;s legacy of work remains unparalleled, setting a standard of excellence that few other writers have matched. Now <i>With These Hands</i> pulls together some of L&#x2019;Amour's very best work&#x2014;eleven newly rediscovered stories that have never before appeared in a single volume. <b><br><br> </b>From a South Seas island paradise to the icy reaches of the Arctic, from the dark, gritty streets of urban America to the rugged landscape of the untamed West, the stories gathered in <i>With These Hands </i>combine razor-sharp characters with breathtaking action and historic detail. Here are tales of adventure, mystery, passion, suspense, and the Old West as only L&#x2019;Amour can tell them. The result is a collection that profoundly echoes the highs and lows of the human experience, while proving that life&#x2019;s most vital moments can occur when and where we least expect them.<br><br> All of the classic L&#x2019;Amour themes are represented: honor, loyalty, and standing up for what&#x2019;s right despite the odds. These dramatic stories grab hold of the reader with a power and immediacy unsurpassed by any other writer. An exotic island in the Coral Sea is transformed into a tropical nightmare when it&#x2019;s taken over by a band of hijackers&#x2014;and only a daredevil pilot can stop their brutal carnage. A former boxer blows the lid off a vicious crime ring&#x2014;and finds that his worst enemy is not a thug with a gun but his own tenacious curiosity. A down-on-his-luck rancher discovers the key to his own redemption&#x2014;and desperately hopes that his revelation has not come too late for him to win the one thing he wants most of all. A private eye navigates the twists and turns of a labyrinthine whodunit&#x2014;and proves that the greatest risk to a man&#x2019;s honor is his own greed. <br><br> The title story <b>"</b>With These Hands" is a powerful tale that celebrates the triumph of the human spirit, as an oil company executive finds himself the sole survivor of an Arctic plane crash. Fighting for his life against the perilous cold and looming starvation, he resists the temptation to surrender to death&#x2014;only to discover a life-affirming strength he never knew he had. <br><br> Vivid in scope and displaying the diverse talents of a master storyteller, the stories in <i>With These Hands</i> are certain to be treasured by both old and new fans, celebrating the incomparable imagination of a timeless American author.</p><p>"Classic L&#x2019;Amour entertainment...All of L&#x2019;Amour&#x2019;s characters are fast with their fists, guns, mouths and wits, defending honor and battling greed and evil."<br>-<i>-Publishers Weekly</i>Our foremost storyteller of the American West,&nbsp;<b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour&nbsp;</b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier.

With over 300,000 copies sold, the popularity of Devin Starlanyl&#39;s book, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain, has demonstrated the widespread demand for reliable material on this subject. If you or someone you love is struggling with fibromyalgia, her new book, The Fibromyalgia Advocate, offers a wealth of practical suggestions for dealing with an often skeptical medical establishment and getting the help and support you need.</p><p>Devin J. Starlanyl specializes in the research and treatment of FMS/MPS and related conditions. She is one of the several support persons who assist FMS/MPS patients through the Internet support group at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, VT. Starlanyl has both conditions, so her books are written from the empathetic perspective of one who understands the disorder from the inside. She lives in West Chesterfield, NH....Starlanyl (Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome: A Survival Manual, LJ 9/15/96) offers an impassioned, in-depth manifesto for FMS and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) patients that explores the wide spectrum of traditional and alternative approaches to these two disorders. Herself a physician living with both FMS and MPS, Starlanyl gives the reader valuable information for working with various health specialists through numerous "data sheets" geared to a particular practitioner, e.g., the cardiologist or dentist. Although her book would seem to accept uncritically many experimental therapies for FMS and MPS, Starlanyl argues that in medicine "hardening of the attitudes" is a common response of clinicians who lack a true understanding of these two painful conditions.

First published in 1957, The Parade is a lost classic, newly discovered, remastered, and presented by Art Spiegelman, the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of Maus. Reproduced in a unique two-sided accordion-fold format with an extensive overview of the artist&#x2019;s career on the verso, The Parade is a celebration of art and the story of recurring war as Si Lewen experienced it over the past 90 years, watching the joyful parades that marked the end of World War I lead into the death marches of World War II and the Korean War. As The Parade unfolds, the reader is taken on an unforgettable journey of sequential images.</p><p><b>Si Lewen</b> was born in Lublin, Poland, on November 8, 1918. During World War II he served in the US Army as one of the Ritchie Boys (German-speaking Special Ops) from the invasion of Normandy to the liberation of Buchenwald. He resumed his career as a painter after the war. Lewen lives in Gwynedd, Pennsylvania. Si Lewen passed away at the Foulkways retirement home in Gwynedd, Pennsylvania, on July 25, 2016.&nbsp;A few days before his death, Art Spiegelman presented him with a finished copy of <i>Si Lewen&#x2019;s Parade: An Artist&#x2019;s Odyssey</i>.

(<i>The New York Times, from an exhibition review of The Parade, 1953</i>)<br><br>"Nothing can equal the psychological effect of real art . . .Our time needs you and your work!" (<i>Albert Einstein, from a letter to Si Lewen, 1951</i>)<br><br>"The Parade is a powerfully moving free-jazz dirge of a book that depicts mankind&#x2019;s recurring war fever. It remains sadly urgent and relevant today." (<i>Art Spiegelman, from his introduction</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A compelling testament to Lewen&#x2019;s gifts for stirring our souls with the silent grace of painted panel after panel after panel.

She was a solidly&nbsp;middle-class, buttoned-up bohemian; an anti-feminist who loved men but scorned free love; a female warrior taking on the male music establishment. She was both the party girl with torn stockings and the sensitive poet.<br><br> She often said she would be criticized for staying the same or changing, so why not take the less boring option? Her earthy, poetic lyrics (&#x201c;the geese in chevron flight&#x201d; in &#x201c;Urge for Going&#x201d;), the phrases that are now part of the culture (&#x201c;They paved paradise, put up a parking lot&#x201d;), and the unusual melodic intervals traced by that lissome voice earned her the status of a pop legend. Fearless experimentation ensured that she will also be seen as one of the most important musicians of the twentieth century.<br><br><i>Joni on Joni</i> is an authoritative, chronologically arranged anthology of some of Mitchell&#x2019;s most illuminating interviews, spanning the years 1966 to 2014. It includes revealing pieces from her early years in Canada and Detroit along with influential articles such as Cameron Crowe&#x2019;s never-before-anthologized <i>Rolling Stone</i> piece. Interspersed throughout the book are key quotes from dozens of additional Q&amp;As.

All the rest is misery," wrote Cesare Pavese, whose short, intense life spanned the ordeals of fascism and World War II to witness the beginnings of Italy's postwar prosperity. Searchingly alert to nuances of speech, feeling, and atmosphere, and remarkably varied, his novels offer a panoramic vision, at once sensual and finely considered, of a time of tumultuous change. This volume presents readers with Pavese's major works. <i>The Beach</i> is a wry summertime comedy of sexual and romantic misunderstandings, while <i>The House on the Hill</i> is an extraordinary novel of war in which a teacher flees through a countryside that is both beautiful and convulsed with terror. <i>Among Women Only</i> tells of a fashion designer who enters the affluent world she has always dreamed of, only to find herself caught up in an eerie dance of destruction, and <i>The Devil in the Hills</i> is an engaging road novel about three young men roaming the hills in high summer who stumble on mysteries of love and death.</p><p>Cesare Pavese (1908&#x2013;1950) was born on his family&#x2019;s vacation farm in the country outside of Turin in northern Italy. He graduated from the University of Turin, where he wrote a thesis on Walt Whitman, beginning a continuing engagement with English-language literature that was to lead to his influential translations of&nbsp;<i>Moby-Dick, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Three Lives</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Moll Flanders</i>, among other works. Briefly exiled by the Fascist regime to Calabria in 1935, Pavese returned to Turin to work for the new publishing house of Giulio Einaudi, where he eventually became the editorial director. In 1936 he published a book of poems,<i>&nbsp;Lavorare stanca (Hard Labor)</i>, and then turned to writing novels and short stories. Pavese won the Strega Prize for fiction, Italy&#x2019;s most prestigious award, for&nbsp;<i>The Moon and the Bonfires</i>&nbsp;in 1950. Later the same year, after a brief affair with an American actress, he committed suicide. Pavese&#x2019;s posthumous publications include his celebrated diaries, essays on American literature, and a second collection of poems, entitled&nbsp;<i>Verr� la morte e avr� i tuoi occhi&nbsp;</i>(<i>Death Will Come and Will Have Your Eyes</i>).<br><br>R.W.&nbsp;Flint translated, edited, and introduced&nbsp;<i>The Selected Works of Cesare Pavese</i>&nbsp;in 1968 and&nbsp;<i>Marinetti: Selected Writings</i>&nbsp;in 1971. He has contributed interviews, essays, translations, and reviews on Italian writers to various journals including<i>Parnassus, Canto</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Italian Quarterly</i>.

As one turns over the pages of this little work, written by Blessed Albert the Great1 towards the end of his life, when that great soul had ripened and matured, one feels that here indeed is the ideal of one&#x2019;s hopes. Simply and clearly the great principles are laid down, the way is made plain which leads to the highest spiritual life. It seems as though, while one reads, the mists of earth vanish and the snowy summits appear of the mountains of God. We breathe only the pure atmosphere of prayer, peace, and love, and the one great fact of the universe, the Divine Presence, is felt and realized without effort.</p><p>Aeterna Press: Low-cost, high quality Christian Paperbacks and E-Books.

Deeper Shades of Purple explores the achievements of this movement over the past two decades and evaluates some of the leading voices and different perspectives within this burgeoning field.<br>Deeper Shades of Purple brings together a who's who of scholars in the study of Black women and religion who view their scholarship through a womanist critical lens. The contributors revisit Alice Walker's definition of womanism for its viability for the approaches to discourses in religion of Black women scholars. Whereas Walker has defined what it means to be womanist, these contributors define what it means to practice womanism, and illuminate how womanism has been used as a vantage point for the theoretical orientations and methodological approaches of Black women scholar-activists.<br>Contributors: Karen Baker-Fletcher, Katie G.

Nick Nolte modeled his character in the movie Extreme Prejudice on him. Jackson even had a speaking part of his own in The Good Old Boys with Tommy Lee Jones. But the role that Jackson has always played the best is that of the man who wears the silver badge cut from a Mexican cinco peso coin&#x2014;a working Texas Ranger. Legend says that one Ranger is all it takes to put down lawlessness and restore the peace&#x2014;one riot, one Ranger. In this adventure-filled memoir, Joaquin Jackson recalls what it was like to be the Ranger who responded when riots threatened, violence erupted, and criminals needed to be brought to justice across a wide swath of the Texas-Mexico border from 1966 to 1993.</p><p>Jackson has dramatic stories to tell. Defying all stereotypes, he was the one Ranger who ensured a fair election&#x2014;and an overwhelming win for La Raza Unida party candidates&#x2014;in Zavala County in 1972. He followed legendary Ranger Captain Alfred Y. Allee Sr. into a shootout at the Carrizo Springs jail that ended a prison revolt&#x2014;and left him with nightmares. He captured "The See More Kid," an elusive horse thief and burglar who left clean dishes and swept floors in the houses he robbed. He investigated the 1988 shootings in Big Bend's Colorado Canyon and tried to understand the motives of the Mexican teenagers who terrorized three river rafters and killed one. He even helped train Afghan mujahedin warriors to fight the Soviet Union.</p><p>Jackson's tenure in the Texas Rangers began when older Rangers still believed that law need not get in the way of maintaining order, and concluded as younger Rangers were turning to computer technology to help solve crimes. Though he insists, "I am only one Ranger. There was only one story that belonged to me," his story is part of the larger story of the Texas Rangers becoming a modern law enforcement agency that serves all the people of the state. It's a story that's as interesting as any of the legends. And yet, Jackson's story confirms the legends, too. With just over a hundred Texas Rangers to cover a state with 267,399 square miles, any one may become the one Ranger who, like Joaquin Jackson in Zavala County in 1972, stops one riot.</p></p><p>H.

DAVID MARION WILKINSON is an award-winning writer whose most recent books are Oblivion&#x2019;s Altar, The Empty Quarter, and Not between Brothers.Former Texas Ranger H. Joaquin Jackson starts off his memoir with the story of the toughest moment in his life, watching his son stand trial for murder. That case wasn't the only one that was personal for the Ranger, since he considered himself a part of the community he watched over. Rex Linn, a Texas native, voices Jackson's memoir as would the man himself-sharing a few laughs over the light moments in his career and dealing straightforwardly with his horror at the violence he encountered. Both Jackson's storytelling and Linn's delivery leave listeners with the feeling that it's been a fun ride, but there's much more left to tell of Jackson's career.

For the U.S. and some European powers the answer is obvious: isolate Russia with punishing economic sanctions, remove it from global institutions such as the G8, and arm the nations directly threatened by Putin. In short, return to the Cold War doctrine that froze Soviet aggression in Europe and helped bring about the collapse of communist Russia. Others argue that such a policy is a dead end. Putin's Russia has legitimate grievances against Western and NATO powers meddling in its sphere of influence. Instead of further antagonizing Putin and risking a dangerous escalation of the current conflict, the U.S. and Europe should seek common cause with Russia to address shared threats, from the Middle East to Asia to combating terrorism.<br><br>In the 15th semi-annual Munk Debate, acclaimed academic Stephen F.

Yet in these essays, many of which have run in places such as Harper's and the New York Times, he reminds us that there is more to education than greater productivity. With prose exacting yet expansive, tough-minded yet optimistic, Edmundson argues forcefully that the liberal arts are more important today than ever.<br><i>Why Teach? </i>offers Edmundson's collected writings on the subject, including several pieces that are new and previously unpublished. What they show, collectively, is that higher learning is not some staid, old notion but a necessary remedy for our troubled times. <i>Why Teach? </i>is brimming with the wisdom and inspiration that make learning possible.</p></p><p><b>Mark Edmundson </b>teaches at the University of Virginia, where he is University Professor.

Everywhere he sees teachers flattering students, confirming their prejudices, and training them for the success game rather than opening their minds to new ways of looking at the world. His teaching ideal, developed here in exemplary detail, is at once utopian and absolutely essential. This book deserves to be widely read.&#x201d; &#x2015;Morris Dickstein, author of Gates of Eden and Dancing in the Dark </p><p>&#x201c;Edmundson may have strong words about culture, education and the common reader's quest to be entertained above all else, but he provides a bracing tonic against the decline of higher education.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Edmundson's accessible prose will motivate both students and teachers.

The questions (what to teach? what to study?) find answers in the values Edmundson discovers in becoming an English major: &#x2018;Love for language, hunger for life, openness and a quest for truth or truths.' Addressing teachers, students, and parents, Edmundson defends the intellectual and spiritual value, even the usefulness, of the &#x2018;scholarly enclave' and &#x2018;seeking knowledge so as to make the lives of other human beings better.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Some of the best essays around about the meaning of a college education.

Hillis Miller, Distinguished Research Professor, University of California, Irvine</p><p>&#x201c;Mark Edmundson manages to be old-fashioned and radical at the same time, skeptical of every latest thing and yet deeply comprehending of students' hyperlinked and hyperactive lives. Edmundson is a school of one, a voice of calm and refection with lessons worth teaching.&#x201d; &#x2015;Edward Ayers, president, University of Richmond</p><p>&#x201c;Mark Edmundson obviously missed the intellectual timidity gene that's so helpful for an academic career. He has the audacity to argue in this book that universities should not be business and consumer training facilities, internet hookup spots, and workout centers, but places where students grapple with &#x2018;perspective-altering' intellectual challenges.&#x201d; &#x2015;Gerald Graff, Professor of English and Education, University of Illinois at Chicago, former President, Modern Language Association</p><p>&#x201c;To read this book is to experience just the kind of course Edmundson admires, one that provokes thought and self-examination. A heartfelt, beautifully written, profound, and often hilarious appeal to rage against the machinery of modern education.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist, starred review</i></p></p><h2>Catherine Certitude</h2><p>This charming book will delight any child or adult who appreciates ballet, Paris, New York, childhood, and mystery (not necessarily in that order). The book's plot is deceptively simple: Catherine, the eponymous heroine, begins her story watching her own daughter demonstrate jazz steps in their ballet school on a snowy afternoon in New York. Memory takes her (and the reader) back to her childhood, spent in the tenth arrondissement of Paris. In her youth, Catherine lives with her gentle father, Georges Certitude, who runs a shipping business with his partner, a loud, failed poet named Casterade. The real partners in this story, however, are the father and daughter who share the simple pleasures of daily life: sitting in the church square, walking to school, going to her ballet class every Thursday afternoon.<br><br>Behind this gossamer storyline, Catherine Certitude is filled with mystery. Why did Georges change his name to Certitude? What kind of trouble with the law did Casterade rescue him from? Exactly what does Georges do, and what kind of deals is he always discussing with men in worn raincoats? Why did Catherine's mother, herself a ballerina, leave Georges to return to New York? That these mysteries remain mysteries is part of the book's charm. But that Catherine and her father love the ballet, music, and City of Lights, is certain.</p><p>Patrick Modiano is a celebrated French novelist, author of numerous books for adults and children.

From the first time I read him, mesmerized by the staggeringly beautiful last lines of &#x2018;Slow Child with a Book of Birds,&#x2019; his voice became a constant companion to me, regardless of whatever distance there might be between myself and where his books sat on my shelf. That voice&#x2015;stoic, curious, sad, funny, and above all, singularly humane&#x2015;was one that I had accepted I would not hear again, but was grateful to have heard at all. After reading <i>The Darkening Trapeze</i>, I can only say what a great and unexpected gift it is to hear that voice again.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Kevin Powers, author of <i>The Yellow Birds</i></b><br><b></b><br>&#x201c;Since his death in 1996, the work of Larry Levis has steadily gathered a kind of literary cult around itself, a passionate crowd of new and old readers. Levis's poetry-philosophical and streetwise, baroque in its textures, syntax, and imagery-earns its charisma. But the deeper reason for the devotion of his readers may be our contemporary starvation for mystery. Levis's poems radiate the conviction that mystery is elemental in the world, and they never reduce that numinous dimension by over-explaining it. The reveries and visions in <i>The Darkening Trapeze</i> will provide readers with a fabulous supply of never-before-published work-a rich, surprising addition to the Levis legacy.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Tony Hoagland</b></p><p>&#x201c;Larry Levis was a master of lyrical thinking. He was our Whitman for the late twentieth century, a conduit of the surreal and real, the past and present, the sung and unsung flowing in the same narrative current. As in the stunning 'Poem Ending with a Hotel on Fire,' <i>The Darkening Trapeze</i> is both brash and elegiac; its meditative darkness always has a restless flame at its heart. These extraordinary last poems give us one more occasion to celebrate one of contemporary poetry's most unique and luminous voices.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Terrance Hayes</b></p><p>&#x201c;Who would have imagined we had yet to receive a gift of this magnitude from the poet Larry Levis? Nothing in these pages suggests the broken remains of 'previously uncollected' work so many writers must endure by way of posthumous tribute. In poem after thrilling poem, Levis manifests the deftness and the daring, the pity and the penetration that made him of such consequence to late twentieth-century American poetry and make him, freshly, of such consequence now.

Independence and democracy were touted by all, but plans for the future of North Korea differed in their ideas about how everyday life should be organized. Daily life came under scrutiny as the primary arena for social change in public and private life. In<i> Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945&#x2013;1950</i>, Kim examines the revolutionary events that shaped people&#x2019;s lives in the development of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

No other producer, not even Florenz Ziegfeld nor the combined lights of the Shubert brothers, has equalled his percentage of hits or his demonic flair for publicity. In this first-ever biography, Howard Kissel from his decade-long investigation reveals the man, the mask, and the myth of David Merrick. The charismatic and reclusive mogul emerges as a Broadway version of Howard Hughes, with his own panoply of eccentricities, genius and neuroses. Merrick's much publicized and oftentimes staged battles and feuds are re-ignited here full force with such major personalities as Barbra Streisand, Jackie Gleason, Ethel Merman, Lena Horne, Woody Allen, Peter Ustinov, Andy Griffith, Anthony Newley, Peter Brook, and Carol Channing. Over a hundred interviews with the major players in Merrick's drama &#x2013; from his pre-Merrick St. Louis childhood as David Margoulies to his latest divorce &#x2013; has yielded the first serious interrogation of a life that until now has been the sole creation of Merrick's own invention and press wizardry.</p><p>A dishy but disappointing first biography of the legendary producer/ogre (who will be 82 in November)--as told by the chief theater critic for the New York Daily News. Kissel tells the story of the guy in the pinstripe suit (a vestment Merrick chose early in his flight from the hollowing meanness of his childhood) who dominated the Broadway theater from the 1950's until he began failing in the 1970's--first out of step, then out of steam, and finally felled by a stroke. Along the way, Merrick specialized in the tony American musical and the classy British import. His shows included Gypsy; Hello, Dolly!; Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead; and Look Back In Anger. Merrick, Kissel explains, had a genius for generating publicity: When Subways Are for Sleeping appeared weak in the knees out of town, he ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Herald- Tribune that featured little raves written by namesakes of prestigious critics. When director Gower Champion died just before the opening of 42nd Street, Merrick squelched all news of his death so he could announce it himself at the final opening-night curtain. No matter that Champion was a friend of old: Merrick was, by Kissel's account, a veritable monster who ruled by tantrum and menace--weapons allegedly honed by old anger and new cocaine. Was Merrick crazy as a fox or just plain crazy? Did his meshugaas help or hinder his fabulous productions? The questions are asked throughout, but the answers are impeded by turgid writing and an erratic overview that shrugs off much of consequence. Kissel's at his best when dealing with the post-stroke Merrick, where the focus is insistently sharp and the pathos keen. (Photographs) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The chief theater critic for the New York Daily News has written a frank portrait of Broadway's most famous producer, a man as renowned for his outrageous behavior and sharp business practices as for the string of hits that began in 1954 with Fanny , continued through the '60s and '70s with Gypsy , Hello, Dolly! and prestigious British imports like Marat/Sade and climaxed in 1980 with the lavish stage version of 42nd Street , which ran for nine years. As documented in his source notes, Kissel has talked to most of Merrick's associates, whose comments scathingly depict him as cruel to subordinates, contemptuous of the artists who created his shows and awful to his many wives. The book is not gratuitously mean, however; Kissel admires Merrick's taste and promotional skills and argues convincingly that his difficult personality stemmed from his extremely unhappy Midwestern childhood. His story is also a social history in miniature of the changing American theater, showing the decline of the middle-class, middlebrow audience that supported Merrick's productions and the rise of nonprofit theaters in which, as one playwright remarks, "No one can make a living except the administrators." Virtually inactive since a debilitating stroke in 1983, Merrick remains the standard against which all commercial producers measure themselves. No theater buff will want to miss this strong--and by no means entirely unsympathetic--biography.

In the short space of 150,000 years, it has undergone behavioural and physiological changes to evolve from a grizzly bear into the most specialized predator of the Arctic sea ice. Yet, its survival is now threatened by global warming. Renowned Polar bear scientist Dr. Ian Stirling compresses 40 years of research on these iconic mammals into a new and comprehensive natural history. In accessible language, he explains their evolution, life history, behaviour, how they are researched, and the current threat to their very existence. He also explains why polar bears of Hudson Bay have become so important to our understanding of the species, and how Churchill became The Polar Bear Capital of the World </p></p><p><p> As a research scientist with the Canadian Wildlife Service and an Adjunct Professor at the University of Alberta, Dr. Ian Stirling has studied the behaviour, population, ecology, and predator-prey relationships of polar bears for 40 years, longer than anyone else in the world. His research in western Hudson Bay provided the first clear demonstration of climate change on resident polar bears there. He is a member of national and international committees on polar bears and marine mammals, and has authored or co-authored over 200 scientific articles and three books. He has won several awards, including the Northern Science Award, and is an Officer of the Order of Canada and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. </p><p></p>&#x201c;With this book &#x2013; the best ever to be written about polar bears - we are blessed with the opportunity to benefit from Ian Stirling&#x2019;s extensive knowledge and life-long experience with this magnificent animal. When he began his study of polar bears more than 40 years ago, knowledge was limited and research methods were crude. Ian and his many colleagues now use modern techniques, ranging from satellite imagery to telemetry equipment to DNA-analyses. The outcome is exciting and fascinating.&nbsp;Ian Stirling is not only a brilliant scientist &#x2013; he has also a profound love for the Arctic&#x2019;s nature and wildlife. He shows us that the far North is not a barren and hostile environment, but unique and beautiful. The fragile Arctic is, however, affected by climate change, transboundary pollution and other disturbances. The new knowledge presented in this book is crucial for conservation and management of Arctic nature and its polar bears.&nbsp;Read Ian Stirling&#x2019;s book, admire the pictures and enjoy. And if you go North, be as careful as he is. Leave nothing but your footprints&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;Dr. Thor S. Larsen.

It covers Rome and Florence, Venice and the Veneto, Assisi, Siena, Milan, Pavia, Genoa, Padua, Mantua, Verona, Ferrara, Urbino and Naples. Chapters are grouped into four chronological parts, allowing for a sustained examination of individual cities in different periods. 'Contemporary Scene' boxes provide fascinating glimpses of daily life and 'Contemporary Voice' boxes quote from painters and writers of the time. Innovative and scholarly, yet accessible and beautifully presented, this book is a definitive work on the Italian Renaissance. This revised edition contains around 200 new pictures and nearly all colour images. The chapter structure has also been improved for yet greater geographic and chronological clarity, and a new page size makes the volume more user-friendly.<br></p><p>&#34;Art mattered in the Renaissance... People expected painting, sculpture, architecture, and other forms of visual art to have a meaningful effect on their lives,&#34; write the authors of this importand new look at Italian Renaissance art. A glance at the pages of Art in Renaissance Italy shows at once its freshness and breadth of approach, which includes thorough explanation into how and why works of art, buildings, prints, and other kinds of art came to be. Also discussed is how men and women of the Rena issance regarded art and artists as well as why works of Renaissance art look the way they do, and what this means to us. Unlike other books on the subject, this one covers not only Florence and Rome, but also covers Venice and the Veneto, Assisi, Siena, Milan, Pavia, Padua, Mantua, Verona, Ferrara, Urbino, and Naples -- each governed in a distinctly different manner, every one with its own political and social structures that inevitably affected artistic styles. Spanning more than three centuries, the narrative brings to life the rich tapestry of Italian Renaissance society and the art works that are its enduring legacy. T hroughout, special features evoke and document the people and places of this dynamic age.Key Benefit: This book accounts the art and artists of Italy during the time period from the mid-thirteenth century to c. 1600. Key Topics: Unlike similar books, which tend to overemphasize Florentine art, this book introduces new material and more extensive discussion of artists from Milan, Venice, Naples and other regions, in addition to coverage of the innovations and critical importance of Florentine art. The authors consider the times, places and conditions in which artists worked in concert with issues of style, thus broadening the scope of coverage to include the dynamics of interaction between artist and patron; artist and topological tradition.</p><h2>Science for Sale: How the US Government Uses Powerful Corporations and Leading Universities to Support Government Policies, Silence Top Scientists, Jeopardize Our Health, and Protect Corporate Profits</h2><p>When Speaker Newt Gingrich greeted Dr. David Lewis in his office overlooking the National Mall, he looked at Dr. Lewis and said: &#x201c;You <i>know</i> you&#x2019;re going to be fired for this, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Dr. Lewis replied, &#x201c;I just hope to stay out of prison.&#x201d; Gingrich had just read Dr. Lewis&#x2019;s commentary in <i>Nature</i>, titled &#x201c;EPA Science: Casualty of Election Politics.&#x201d; Three years later, and thirty years after Dr. Lewis began working at EPA, he was back in Washington to receive a Science Achievement Award from Administrator Carol Browner for his second article in <i>Nature</i>.

Organizations dealing with scientific integrity are designed only to weed out those who commit fraud behind the backs of the institutions where they work. The greatest threat of all is the purposeful corruption of the scientific enterprise by the institutions themselves. The science they create is often only an illusion, designed to deceive; and the scientists they destroy to protect that illusion are often our best. This book is about both, beginning with Dr. Lewis&#x2019;s experience, and ending with the story of Dr. Andrew Wakefield.</p><p><b>David L.

City in flames.' And, she continued, 'Had my wedding dress fitted. Lovely.' </p><p>For Gladys Mason, and for thousands of women throughout the long years of the war, fashion was not simply a distraction, but a necessity - and one they weren't going to give up easily. In the face of bombings, conscription, rationing and ludicrous bureaucracy, they maintained a sense of elegance and style with determination and often astonishing ingenuity. From the young woman who avoided the dreaded 'forces bloomers' by making knickers from military-issue silk maps, to "Vogue"'s indomitable editor Audrey Withers, who balanced lobbying government on behalf of her readers with driving lorries for the war effort, Julie Summers weaves together stories from ordinary lives and high society to provide a unique picture of life during the Second World War. </p><p>As a nation went into uniform and women took on traditional male roles, clothing and beauty began to reflect changing social attitudes. For the first time, fashion was influenced not only by Hollywood and high society but by the demands of industrial production and the pressing need to 'make-do-and-mend'. Beautifully illustrated and full of gorgeous detail, "Fashion on the Ration "lifts the veil on a fascinating era in British fashion.</p></p><p>Julie Summers is the author of Jambusters: the story of the Women&#39;s Institute in the Second World War, which inspired ITV&#39;s 2015 hugely successful drama Home Fires, now into a second series.

Few histories capture so simply yet vividly the monotony and grind of ordinary life for the British at home, when patriotism and fear were leavened, daily, by the increasingly irritating restrictions on what people could wear ... a riveting social history of the kind that looks narrow, yet encompasses every individual - infants as well as the elderly - who had to endure these years ...

Yet despite this unprecedented calamity, Jewish Holocaust survivors returning to their hometowns in Poland after the war were further subjected to terror and bloodshed. The deadliest peacetime pogrom in twentieth-century Europe took place in the Polish town of Kielce on July 4, 1946.<br><br> In <i>Fear,</i> Jan T. Gross addresses a vexing question: How was this possible? At the center of his investigation is a detailed reconstruction of the Kielce pogrom and how ordinary Poles responded to the spectacle of Jews being murdered by their fellow citizens. Anti-Semitism, Gross argues, became a common currency between the Communist regime and a society in which many were complicit in the Nazi campaign of plunder and murder&#x2014;and for whom the Jewish survivors were a standing reproach.<br><br> For more than half a century, the fate of Jewish Holocaust survivors in Poland was cloaked in guilt and shame. Writing with passion, brilliance, and fierce clarity, Jan T. Gross brings to light a truth that must never be ignored.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Fear</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;That a civilized nation could have descended so low . . . such behavior must be documented, remembered, discussed.

Its primary focus is on the 1946 pogrom in Kielce, Poland, the worst case of anti-Jewish violence in postwar Europe. I remain shaken to the core by what he has related about Kielce and the violence that radiated out from the pogrom. Among the questions Gross asks are: How could it be that the persecution of the Jews continued after the Nazis were long gone? Why did the Jews need to flee Poland after the war? How was it that after the liberation those Poles who had protected and sheltered Jews were tormented by and afraid of their compatriots? Gross suggests that the answers lie in the nasty behavior of Poles toward the Jews during the war. It has to do with taking Jewish property and betraying Jewish Poles to the Nazis. The fear came from being faced with what they had done during the war; the surviving Jews reminded them of their recent rapacious and immoral past. Gross is a brilliant writer. There is never anything ponderous about his prose. It's clear and engaging, even if the stories he has to tell are terrifying."<b>--Norman Naimark, Hoover Institution</b></p><p>"Jan Gross's <i>Fear</i> is an extraordinary account and analysis of postwar Polish anti-Semitism. In many ways, this book is a sequel to Gross's celebrated <i>Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland</i>. While Neighbors described and analyzed the assault by Polish citizens on their Jewish neighbors in the immediate aftermath of the German occupation of East Poland in the summer of 1941, <i>Fear</i> reconstructs and interprets physical and ideological attacks on Jews by Poles after Poland's liberation from the Nazis. But unlike the case of Jedwabne, here no one can argue about the presence or absence of German perpetrators. Anyone who reads this frightening account will realize the intensity and pervasiveness of anti-Jewish sentiments in postwar Polish society. This is a passionate yet well-documented, powerfully argued, and tightly controlled book. It is remarkable."<b>--Omer Bartov, Brown University</b></p><b>Jan T.

Howard's book arguably is the most comprehensive treatment of spirituality from an evangelical perspective in the English language."--<b>Bruce Demarest</b>, Denver Seminary<br><br><i>From the Introduction<br></i>I tend to be a "big picture" kind of guy. My students tell me that they get the most out of my teaching when I show how a number of different things fit together. And while I constantly face the dangers of a distorting totalization, I find that my preoccupation with big pictures often helps students see things in a new light. I hope to accomplish something of the same in this text. So, in order to make this book illuminating, I have incorporated a couple of elements characteristic of my own study and teaching of Christian spirituality.<br><br>First, this text draws from a variety of different resources. . . . The study of Christian spirituality--as an exploration of the relationship between God and human persons--necessarily involves both theological categories (requiring biblical, dogmatic, and historical study) and categories from the human sciences (requiring psychological and sociological study). Furthermore, the exploration of Christian spirituality involves both formal academic research and informal personal experience. Prayer, for example, has been explored not only by the saints and mystics of history, but also by medical researchers, cognitive psychologists, anthropologists, and philosophers of religion, as well as by people like you and me. What insights might these diverse resources bring to our understanding of Christian prayer? My aim is not to provide a comprehensive coverage of any single discipline . . . but rather to point to the key questions, figures, and ideas that shed light on the general survey of Christian spirituality and to illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach to Christian spirituality might look.<br><br>Second, this text provides a survey of Christian spirituality within a single coherent framework (the "big picture"). My goal is to give some insight concerning how various traditions, practices, and perspectives can be comprehended as a whole. To this end the text will develop, though not defend, a way of looking at the God-human relationship that helps make sense of a number of details regarding the spiritual life. The chapters are designed to present this framework piece by piece and then to apply this framework to the practical dimensions of Christian spirituality as the book progresses. For this reason the book moves from the more difficult material to the easier, progressing from method to theology to dynamics to practice.</p><h2>Her Darkest Nightmare (Dr. Evelyn Talbot Novels, 1)</h2><p><p><i>Her Darkest Nightmare</i>, first in an electrifying new series from <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Brenda Novak</p><p> <b>THE HUNT FOR A SERIAL KILLER</b></p><p>Evelyn Talbot knows that a psychopath can look perfectly normal.

But though the individual psalms arose from an assortment of times, experiences and settings, the book is composed in a deliberate pattern, not as a random anthology. The meaning of the Psalms is discovered in this pattern and order. Michael Wilcock has written a sort of travel guide to the Psalms. In the first volume, <em>The Message of Psalms 1--72,</em> he invites us to begin our journey through the gateway of Psalms 1 and 2, with their summons to obedience. In this volume, he ends with Psalm 150, singing its song of praise. In between we pass through all the "yes, buts" of faith--the conflicts, the burdens, the mysteries and the sufferings of life. In these laments and praises, hymns and liturgies, the Bible continues to speak clearly today.</p><p>Wilcock was formerly director of pastoral studies at Trinity College, Bristol. He has now also retired from many years of pastoring churches in the United Kingdom, most recently St. Nicholas&#39; Church, Durham.&#34;&#39;I have found The Bible Speaks Today volumes inspirational and scholarly, and of enormous practical use.&#39; Stephen Gaukroger&#34;</p><h2>Capital: A Critique of Political Economy - Volume 3: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole</h2><p>A classic of early modernism, <em>Capital</em> combines vivid historical detail with economic analysis to produce a bitter denunciation of mid-Victorian capitalist society.

Like the best modernist fiction, <i>Ripley</i> works on two levels. First, it is the story of a young man, Tom Ripley, whose nihilistic tendencies lead him on a deadly passage across Europe. On another level, the novel is a commentary on fictionmaking and techniques of narrative persuasion. Like Humbert Humbert, Tom Ripley seduces readers into empathizing with him even as his actions defy all moral standards.<p> The novel begins with a play on James's <i>The Ambassadors</i>. Tom Ripley is chosen by the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf to retrieve Greenleaf's son, Dickie, from his overlong sojourn in Italy. Dickie, it seems, is held captive both by the Mediterranean climate and the attractions of his female companion, but Mr. Greenleaf needs him back in New York to help with the family business. With an allowance and a new purpose, Tom leaves behind his dismal city apartment to begin his career as a return escort. But Tom, too, is captivated by Italy. He is also taken with the life and looks of Dickie Greenleaf. He insinuates himself into Dickie's world and soon finds that his passion for a lifestyle of wealth and sophistication transcends moral compunction. Tom will become Dickie Greenleaf--at all costs.</p><p> Unlike many modernist experiments, <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i> is eminently readable and is driven by a gripping chase narrative that chronicles each of Tom's calculated maneuvers of self-preservation. Highsmith was in peak form with this novel, and her ability to enter the mind of a sociopath and view the world through his disturbingly amoral eyes is a model that has spawned such latter-day serial killers as Hannibal Lecter. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Read by Michael Hayden<br>Six cassettes / approx. 10 hours<p><b>The chilling crime fiction classic--now a major motion picture from Paramount, starring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Jude Law, written and directed by Anthony Minghella (</b><b><i>The English Patient</i></b><b>), and produced by Sydney Pollack.</b></p><p>In Tom Ripley, Patricia Highsmith created the perfect criminal. In <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, circumstances and opportunities transform him from a petty perpetrator of fraud into a suave, agreeable, and totally amoral artist of crime, who will stop at nothing--certainly not a single murder--to get what he desires.</p></p><h2>IBM: The Rise and Fall and Reinvention of a Global Icon (History of Computing)</h2><p><p><b>A history of one of the most influential American companies of the last century.</b></p><p>For decades, IBM shaped the way the world did business. IBM products were in every large organization, and IBM corporate culture established a management style that was imitated by companies around the globe. It was &#x201c;Big Blue, &#x201d; an icon. And yet over the years, IBM has gone through both failure and success, surviving flatlining revenue and forced reinvention. The company almost went out of business in the early 1990s, then came back strong with new business strategies and an emphasis on artificial intelligence. In this authoritative, monumental history, James Cortada tells the story of one of the most influential American companies of the last century.</p><p>Cortada, a historian who worked at IBM for many years, describes IBM's technology breakthroughs, including the development of the punch card (used for automatic tabulation in the 1890 census), the calculation and printing of the first Social Security checks in the 1930s, the introduction of the PC to a mass audience in the 1980s, and the company's shift in focus from hardware to software. He discusses IBM's business culture and its orientation toward employees and customers; its global expansion; regulatory and legal issues, including antitrust litigation; and the track records of its CEOs. The secret to IBM's unequalled longevity in the information technology market, Cortada shows, is its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and technologies.</p></p><p>James W. Cortada is Senior Research Fellow at the Charles Babbage Institute at the University of Minnesota and the author of <i>Information and the Modern Corporation</i> (MIT Press) and other books. He worked at IBM for thirty-eight years in sales, consulting, managerial, and research positions.<p>This book is the first authoritative business and technical history of IBM to appear in fifteen years&#x2015;and a lot has happened in that time. Often overshadowed by the new Titans of the Internet Era, IBM with its 400,000 employees remains the world's oldest and largest supplier of computer services. Jim Cortada is especially well qualified to write this book&#x2015;as both one of our most respected and prolific computer historians and a life-long IBMer.</p>&#x2015;<b>Martin Campbell-Kelly</b>, Warwick University<br><br><p>Jim Cortada's wonderful book took me back fifty years. My entire business education began with IBM, a company with a unique culture and ethos.&nbsp;At IBM I learned a seemingly obvious lesson, one that many modern companies (and later even IBM) ignored, that long-term success is dependent on how you treat your customers and employees. Cortada makes that culture and ethos the centerpiece of his magnificent history, documenting the vast changes that we as a society have faced and how IBM has always been there with us, in good and bad times for us both.</p>&#x2015;<b>Ernest E. [Lee] Keet</b>, President, Vanguard Atlantic Ltd.<br><br><p>In <i>IBM:The Rise and Fall and Reinvention of a Global Icon</i>, Dr. Cortada gives us the fullest possible perspective of IBM's leadership and presence in our evolving technology-centric world. We sit at the feet of a master observer, storyteller, and technologist. It is unlikely that any other person holds the depth of direct experience and observation skills he possesses to be able to tell this remarkable story. It is an essential work for one wishing to understand the historical development of our global technology industry.</p>&#x2015;<b>David G.

He would be the last. This is the first history of the ruler, known as Boabdil, whose disastrous reign and bitter defeat brought seven centuries of Moorish Spain to an end. It is an action-packed story of intrigue, treachery, cruelty, cunning, courtliness, bravery and tragedy. </p><p> Basing her vivid account on original documents and sources, Elizabeth Drayson traces the origins and development of Islamic Spain. She describes the thirteenth-century founding of the Nasrid dynasty, the cultured and stable society it created, and the feuding which threatened it and had all but destroyed it by 1482, when Boabdil seized the throne. The new Sultan faced betrayals by his family, factions in the Alhambra palace, and ever more powerful onslaughts from the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella, monarchs of the newly united kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. </p><p>By stratagem, diplomacy, courage and strength of will Boabdil prolonged his reign for ten years, but he never had much chance of survival. In 1492 Ferdinand and Isabella, magnificently attired in Moorish costume, entered Granada and took possession of the city. Boabdil went into exile. The Christian reconquest of Spain, that has reverberated so powerfully down the centuries, was complete.</p></p><p></p><h2>Race in the Schoolyard: Negotiating the Color Line in Classrooms and Communities (Rutgers Series in Childhood Studies)</h2><p><p>"Race in the Schoolyard is a wonderful book for social scientists studying race, education, and childhood studies.

While race of course is not officially taught like multiplication and punctuation, she finds that it nonetheless insinuates itself into everyday life in schools.</p><p>Lewis explains how the curriculum, both expressed and hidden, conveys many racial lessons. While teachers and other school community members verbally deny the salience of race, she illustrates how it does influence the way they understand the world, interact with each other, and teach children.

Because the church claims to be a community of faith, it does not reach decisions simply on the basis of good management policy, or the analysis of market trends, or efficiency, or even ideological consistency, but in response to God's activity in the world that presses upon us and urges us to decision. </p> <p>Faced with how to respond to God's leading, the church decides what to do on the basis of two realities: Scripture and discernment. Because it calls the church into being Scripture is the fundamental authority in the church's life. Yet it is not enough for a congregation simply to turn to the Bible when a decision must be reached, for Scripture does not directly address all issues which face the church today, and those it does often reflect greatly differing historical and social contexts than our own. </p> <p>Thus, added to the authority of Scripture in the church's decision making is a process of discernment, in which the members of the community--under the guidance of the Holy Spirit--recall how God has worked in their lives as individuals and as a community and discern together God's direction for the future. Johnson argues that this very pattern of decision making can be found in Scripture itself, notably in one of the central events of the book of Acts. Beginning with the conversion of Cornelius and culminating in the Apostolic Council of Acts 15, we see how a string of smaller narratives combine to tell the story of God's movement within their midst, and how this narrative became the basis for the reinterpretation of Scripture and the inclusion of Gentiles into the fellowship of the church. </p> <p>Looking at a number of thorny issues facing the contemporary church, Johnson demonstrates how the interaction of Scripture and discernment can and must become the basis for how we respond to the decisions with which the church wrestles today.</p></p><p>Luke T.

It is also the newest classic in the canon of world literature. Lost for centuries to the sands of the Middle East but found again in the 1850s, it tells the story of a great king, his heroism, and his eventual defeat. It is a story of monsters, gods, and cataclysms, and of intimate friendship and love. Acclaimed literary historian Michael Schmidt provides a unique meditation on the rediscovery of <i>Gilgamesh</i> and its profound influence on poets today.</p><p>Schmidt describes how the poem is a work in progress even now, an undertaking that has drawn on the talents and obsessions of an unlikely cast of characters, from archaeologists and museum curators to tomb raiders and jihadis. Fragments of the poem, incised on clay tablets, were scattered across a huge expanse of desert when it was recovered in the nineteenth century. The poem had to be reassembled, its languages deciphered. The discovery of a pre-Noah flood story was front-page news on both sides of the Atlantic, and the poem's allure only continues to grow as additional cuneiform tablets come to light. Its translation, interpretation, and integration are ongoing.</p><p>In this illuminating book, Schmidt discusses the special fascination <i>Gilgamesh</i> holds for contemporary poets, arguing that part of its appeal is its captivating otherness. He reflects on the work of leading poets such as Charles Olson, Louis Zukofsky, and Yusef Komunyakaa, whose own encounters with the poem are revelatory, and he reads its many translations and editions to bring it vividly to life for readers.</p></p><p>This is a short and accessible book about <i>the Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, what we might know of its composition, its discovery in scattered tablets centuries later, and its rich legacy and reception.<b>Michael Schmidt</b> is a literary historian, poet, novelist, translator, and anthologist as well as an editor and publisher.

First, however, his loved ones have some things to work out. <br> David, the older son, believes that any minute his life is going to fall apart and everyone he loves will leave him. His brother Scott can't shake the belief that at heart, people are inherently rotten.

Full of stories, yet written in a condensed, imagistic language, his essays are works of the imagination where all the facts are verifiable. As entertaining as fiction and as vivid as poems, making unexpected stops in odd corners of the globe or forgotten moments in human history, erudite, politically engaged, and acerbically witty, there is nothing quite like his work in contemporary writing. In&nbsp;<em>Karmic Traces</em>, his third collection with New Directions, twenty-four essays take the reader along on the author&#x2019;s personal travels from the Atacama Desert to Iceland to Hong Kong on the verge of the hand-over to China, as well as on imagined voyages on a 17th-century Danish ship bound for India and among strange religious cults or even stranger small animals. One never knows what will appear next: Viking dreams, Aztec rituals, Hindu memory, laughing fish, or prophetic dogs. And in &#x201c;The Falls,&#x201d; the long tour-de-force that closes the book, Weinberger recapitulates 3,000 years of history in a cascade of telling facts to uncovering the deep roots of contemporary racism and violence.</p><p>Eliot Weinberger is an essayist, editor, and translator.

And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?" -- Mark Twain</p><p>Ross Thomas chose the quotation from Huckleberry Finn as the text of his post World War II story as well as for the title. When Lucifer Dye is released from three months in a Hong Kong prison, debriefed, handed a false passport, a new wardrobe and a $20,000 check, his haughty control makes it clear that Dye's career with his country has been permanently terminated. But a good agent is always in demand, and just a few hours later Dye is being interviewed for a highly ingenious position. Victor Orcutt, although a not very good imitation of a British pre-war gent, has creative talents of his own. He has his sights a small southern city, with the ordinary run-of-the-mill corruption one would expect in such a place. The canny Orcott knows there's no profit in that . His creed is "To get better, it must be much worse." He and his two associates have looked up Dye's history, and he now offers the ex-spy's a mission. For two and a half times the government's bounty, Dye is to thoroughly corrupt the town. And the sly Dye takes the offer.</p></p><p><p><b>Ross Thomas</b> is ranked as one of the very top thriller writers by his fellow authors, and his readers loudly agree.

Little attention is given to how most lobbyists simply do their job or become effective at what they do. Whether it&#39;s helping staff draft legislative language, providing members with quality policy and political information, or just being a good listener, lobbyists must build and maintain relationships. If they do, they&#39;ll succeed in advancing their policy objectives within the give-and-take process of the American legislative system. The Art of Lobbying examines strategies and techniques from the perspective of those who are lobbied - the people who know what resonates and what falls upon deaf ears in congressional offices. A former longtime lobbyist himself, Levine has interviewed more than 40 current or former members of Congress, along with their staffers, to give a thorough review of the relevant academic literature and offer a behind-the-scenes perspective on what constitutes the art of lobbying.</p><p><p><strong>Bertram J. Levine</strong> is the Charles Evans Hughes Fellow in Political Science (Emeritus) at Colgate University and a member of the Rutgers University Political Science Department. Prior to pursuing his PhD, he was Vice President of Federal Government Relations and State Government Relations for Johnson and Johnson. In that capacity, he headed the company&#x2019;s lobbying efforts in Washington, DC. During the 92nd and 93rd Congresses he served as a counsel to the Energy and Commerce Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. Levine is the coauthor of <em>Lobbying Congress: How the System Works,</em> Second Edition. He has also authored a number of articles on interest groups and lobbying.</p></p><h2>The Science of the Art of Psychotherapy (Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology)</h2><p><p><strong>The latest work from a pioneer in the study of the development of the self.</strong></p> Focusing on the hottest topics in psychotherapy&#x2015;attachment, developmental neuroscience, trauma, the developing brain&#x2015;this book provides a window into the ideas of one of the best-known writers on these topics. Following Allan Schore&#x2019;s very successful books on affect regulation and dysregulation, also published by Norton, this is the third volume of the trilogy. It offers a representative collection of essential expansions and elaborations of regulation theory, all written since 2005.<br><p>As in the first two volumes of this series, each chapter represents a further development of the theory at a particular point in time, presented in chronological order. Some of the earlier chapters have been re-edited: those more recent contain a good deal of new material that has not been previously published.</p><p>The first part of the book, Affect Regulation Therapy and Clinical Neuropsychoanalysis, contains chapters on the art of the craft, offering interpersonal neurobiological models of the change mechanism in the treatment of all patients, but especially in patients with a history of early relational trauma. These chapters contain contributions on &#x201c;modern attachment theory&#x201d; and its focus on the essential nonverbal, unconscious affective mechanisms that lie beneath the words of the patient and therapist; on clinical neuropsychoanalytic models of working with relational trauma and pathological dissociation: and on the use of affect regulation therapy (ART) in the emotionally stressful, heightened affective moments of clinical enactments.</p><p>The chapters in the second part of the book on Developmental Affective Neuroscience and Developmental Neuropsychiatry address the science that underlies regulation theory&#x2019;s clinical models of development and psychopathogenesis. Although most mental health practitioners are actively involved in child, adolescent, and adult psychotherapeutic treatment, a major theme of the latter chapters is that the field now needs to more seriously attend to the problem of early intervention and prevention.</p><p><strong>Praise for Allan N. Schore:</strong></p><p>"Allan Schore reveals himself as a polymath, the depth and breadth of whose reading&#x2013;bringing together neurobiology, developmental neurochemistry, behavioral neurology, evolutionary biology, developmental psychoanalysis, and infant psychiatry&#x2013;is staggering." &#x2013;<em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em></p><p>"Allan Schore's...work is leading to an integrated evidence-based dynamic theory of human development that will engender a rapproachement between psychiatry and neural sciences."&#x2013;<em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em></p><p>"One cannot over-emphasize the significance of Schore's monumental creative labor...Oliver Sacks' work has made a great deal of difference to neurology, but Schore's is perhaps even more revolutionary and pivotal...His labors are Darwinian in scope and import."&#x2013;<em>Contemporary Psychoanalysis</em></p><p>"Schore's model explicates in exemplary detail the precise mechanisms in which the infant brain might internalize and structuralize the affect-regulating functions of the mother, in circumscribed neural tissues, at specifiable points in it epigenetic history." &#x2013;<em>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic</em></p><p>"Allan Schore has become a heroic figure among many psychotherapists for his massive reviews of neuroscience that center on the patient-therapist relationship." &#x2013;Daniel Goleman, author of <em>Social Intelligence</em></p></p><p>Allan N. Schore, PhD, is on the clinical faculty of the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, and at the UCLA Center for Culture, Brain, and Development. He is the recipient of the American Psychological Association Division 56: Trauma Psychology "Award for Outstanding Contributions to Practice in Trauma Psychology" and APA's Division 39: Psychoanalysis "Scientific Award in Recognition of Outstanding Contributions to Research, Theory and Practice of Neuroscience and Psychoanalysis."He is also an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association. He is author of three seminal volumes,&nbsp;Affect Regulation and the Origin of the Self, Affect Dysregulation and Disorders of the Self and Affect Regulation and the Repair of the Self, as well as numerous articles and chapters. His Regulation Theory, grounded in developmental neuroscience and developmental psychoanalysis, focuses on the origin, psychopathogenesis, and psychotherapeutic treatment of the early forming subjective implicit self. His contributions appear in multiple disciplines, including developmental neuroscience, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, developmental psychology, attachment theory, trauma studies, behavioral biology, clinical psychology, and clinical social work. His groundbreaking integration of neuroscience with attachment theory has lead to his description as "the American Bowlby" and with psychoanalysis as "the world's leading expert in neuropsychoanalysis." His books have been translated into several languages, including Italian, French, German, and Turkish.&#x201c;Schore weaves together, in a seemingly effortless fashion, left and right, science and art, head and heart, and theory and practice, managing somehow to make tremendously complex subject matter at once accessible, compelling, and clinically useful. So settle in, savor every morsel, enjoy every moment, engage both sides of your brain&#x2015;and you will be richly rewarded for your efforts. . . . [A] must-read for health professionals and interested lay persons alike.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Psychoanalytic Psychology</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Schore has been a pioneer in writing about integrative neurobiological models of development . . . . [T]he text is of great value to anyone interested in the theoretical basis underlying attachment and affect regulation. Of particular interest to psychotherapists is that the book explores how psychotherapists&#x2019; neurobiology may be altered as a function of the practice of psychotherapy. . . . [O]f value to teachers who want to integrate important findings about current neuroscience into psychotherapy training. Any clinician who believes in the centrality of developmental processes regarding the understanding of adult patients will be riveted by the descriptions of the interdisciplinary data that support our theories of attachment and emotion regulation. . . . I recommend that all psychiatrists become conversant with Dr. Shore&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One would be hard pressed to find another book so extensively filled with an up-to-date and extensive review of contemporary studies on the affective and neuroscience literature related to psychotherapy and psychoanalysis as this. This work will likely be a major reference source for those interested in understanding the brain-mind-body relationships, particularly in the two person model, focused on the dissociative process, and the autonomic nervous system concomitants.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Journal of Analytical Psychology</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I would recommend <em>The Science of the Art of Psychotherapy</em> to child psychiatry/psychology fellows, psychoanalysts, family therapists, . . . neuroscience majors, psychology students at all levels of training, and any student of attachment therapy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Journal of Psychiatric Practice</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[S]chore's contribution continues to be invaluable.

But when Barbicane&#x2019;s adversary places a huge wager that the project will fail and a daring volunteer elevates the mission to a &#x201c;manned&#x201d; flight, one man&#x2019;s dream turns into an international space race. <br><br>A story of rip-roaring action, humor, and wild imagination, <b>From the Earth to the Moon</b> is as uncanny in its accuracy and as filled with authentic detail and startling immediacy as Verne&#x2019;s timeless masterpieces <b>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea </b>and <b>Around the World in Eighty Days. </b><i><br><br></i></p><p>Jules Verne was born into a family with seafaring tradition in Nantes, France, in 1828. At an early age he tried to run off and ship out as a cabin boy but was stopped and returned to his family. Verne was sent to Paris to study law, but once there, he quickly fell in love with the theater. He was soon writing plays and opera librettos, and his first play was produced in 1850. When he refused his father&#x2019;s entreaties to return to Nantes and practice law, his allowance was cut off, and he was forced to make his living by selling stories and articles.<br><br>Verne combined his gift for exotic narratives with an interest the latest scientific discoveries. He spent long hours in the Paris libraries studying geology, astronomy, and engineering. Soon he was turning out imaginative stories such as <i>Five Weeks in a Balloon</i> (1863) and <b>Journey to the Center of the Earth</b> (1864), which were immensely popular all over the world. After<i> </i><b>From the Earth to the Moon</b> (1865), Verne received letter from travelers wishing to sign up for the next lunar expedition. His ability to envision the next stage in man&#x2019;s technology progress and his childlike wonder at the possibilities produced <b>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</b><i> </i>(1870) and <i>Michael Strogoff </i>(1876). His biggest success came with <b>Around the World in Eighty Days</b> (1872).<br><br>Verne&#x2019;s books made him famous and rich. In 1876 he bought a large steam yacht, outfitted with a cabin in which he could write more comfortably than on shore. He sailed from one European port to another and was lionized everywhere he went. His books were widely translated, dramatized, and later filmed. He died at Aminens in 1905.<i>Chapter One<br>The Gun Club<br></i><br>DURING THE Civil War in the United States an influential club was formed in Baltimore. The vigor with which the military instinct developed in that nation of ship owners, merchants, and mechanics is well known. Shopkeepers left their counters and became captains, colonels, and generals without ever having gone to West Point. They soon equaled their Old World colleagues in the "art of war" and, like them, won victories by lavishly expending ammunition, money, and men.<br><br>But in the science of ballistics the Americans far surpassed the Europeans. Not that their guns attained a higher degree of perfection, but they were made much larger and therefore reached much greater ranges. When it comes to grazing fire, plunging fire, direct fire, oblique fire, or raking fire, the English, French, and Prussians have nothing to learn, but their cannons, howitzers, and mortars are only pocket pistols compared to the awesome engines of the American artillery.<br><br>This should surprise no one. The Yankees, the world's best mechanics, are engineers the way Italians are mu_sicians and Germans are metaphysicians: by birth. Nothing could then be more natural than for them to bring their bold ingenuity to the science of ballistics. The wonders performed in this domain by men like Parrott, Dahlgren, and Rodman are known to everyone. Armstrong, Paliser, and Treuille de Beaulieu could only bow to their transatlantic rivals.<br><br>And so during the terrible struggle between the North and the South the artillerymen reigned supreme. The Union newspapers enthusiastically extolled their inventions, and there was no tradesman so humble, no idler so guileless that he did not rack his brain day and night calculating fantastic trajectories.<br><br>Now when an American has an idea he looks for another American who shares it. If there are three of them they elect a president and two vice presidents. If there are four they appoint a secretary and their staff is ready to function. If there are five they convene in a general assembly and their club is formed. That was how it happened in Baltimore. A man who had invented a new cannon associated himself with the man who had cast it and the man who had bored it. That was the nucleus of the Gun Club. A month after its formation it had 1,833 resident members and 30,575 corresponding members.<br><br>There was one strict condition for membership in the club: the applicant had to have invented or at least improved a cannon; or if not a cannon, some other kind of firearm. But it must be said that inventors of fifteen-shot revolvers, pivoting rifles, or saber pistols were not held in high esteem. The artillerymen took precedence over them in all circumstances.<br><br>"The respect they get," one of the most learned orators of the Gun Club said one day, "is proportional to the mass of their cannons and in direct ratio to the square of the distances reached by their projectiles." This was almost a psychological application of Newton's law of gravity.<br><br>Once the Gun Club had been founded, it was easy to imagine the results produced by the Americans' inventive genius. Their cannons took on colossal proportions, and their projectiles reached out beyond all normal limits to cut harmless strollers in half. All these inventions outstripped the timid instruments of European artillery, as the following figures will show.<br><br>In the "good old days," a 36-pound cannon ball would go through 36 horses and 68 men at a distance of 100 yards. The art was still in its infancy. It has come a long way since then. The Rodman cannon, which shot a projectile weighing half a ton to a distance of seven miles, could easily have flattened 150 horses and 300 men. The Gun Club considered testing this, but while the horses raised no objection to the experiment, it was unfortunately impossible to find men willing to take part in it.<br><br>Be that as it may, these cannons had extremely murderous effects. With each of their shots, combatants fell like wheat before the scythe. Compared to such projectiles what was the famous cannon ball which put twenty-five men out of action at Coutras in 1587, or the one that killed forty infantrymen at Zorndorf in 1758, or the Austrian cannon that felled seventy enemy soldiers each time it was fired at Kesseldorf in 1742? What was the amazing gunfire at Jena or Austerlitz, which decided the outcome of the battle? There was real artillery in the Civil War! At the battle of Gettysburg a conical projectile shot from a rifled cannon struck down 173 Confederates, and during the crossing of the Potomac a Rodman ball sent 215 Southerners into an obviously better world. We must also mention the formidable mortar invented by J. T. Maston, distinguished member and permanent secretary of the Gun Club. It was more lethal than any of the others, for it killed 337 people the first time it was fired, though it is true that it did so by bursting.<br><br>What can we add to these figures, so eloquent in themselves? Nothing. It will therefore be easy to accept the calculation made by the statistician Pitcairn: he divided the number of members in the Gun Club by the number of victims of their cannon balls and found that each member had killed an average of 2,375 and a fraction men.<br><br>From this figure it is clear that the aims of that learned society were the destruction of the human race for philanthropical reasons and the improvement of war weapons, regarded as instruments of civilization. It was an assemblage of Angels of Death who at the same time were thoroughly decent men.<br><br>It must be added that these dauntless Yankees did not confine themselves to theory: they also acquired direct, practical experience. Among them were officers of all ranks, from lieutenant to general, soldiers of all ages, some who had just begun their military career and others who had grown old over their gun carriages. Many fell on the field of battle, and their names were inscribed on the Gun Club's honor roll. Most of those who came back bore the marks of their unquestionable valor. Crutches, wooden legs, artificial arms with iron hooks at the wrist, rubber jaws, silver skulls, platinum noses&#x2014;nothing was lacking in the collection. The aforementioned Pitcairn calculated that in the Gun Club there was not quite one arm for every four men, and only one leg for every three.<br><br>But these valiant artillerymen paid little heed to such trifles, and they felt rightfully proud when a battle report showed the number of casualties to be ten times as great as the number of projectiles used.<br><br>One day, however, one sad and wretched day, the survivors of the war made peace. The shooting gradually died down; the mortars fell silent; muzzled howitzers and drooping cannons were taken back to their arsenals; cannon balls were piled up in parks; bloody memories faded; cotton grew magnificently in abundantly fertilized fields; mourning clothes and the grief they represented began to wear thin, and the Gun Club was plunged in idle boredom.<br><br>A few relentless workers still made ballistic calculations and went on dreaming of gigantic, incomparable projectiles. But without opportunities for practical application these theories were meaningless, and so the rooms of the Gun Club became deserted, the servants dozed in the antechambers, the newspapers gathered dust on the tables, sounds of sad snoring came from the dark corners, and the members, once so noisy, now reduced to silence by a disastrous peace, lethargically abandoned themselves to visions of platonic artillery.<br><br>"It's disheartening!" the worthy Tom Hunter said one evening while his wooden legs were slowly charring in front of the fireplace in the smoking room. "There's nothing to do, nothing to hope for! What a tedious life! Where are the days when we were awakened every morning by the joyful booming of cannons?"<br><br>"Those days are gone," replied the dashing Bilsby, trying to stretch his missing arms. "How wonderful they were! You could invent a howitzer and try it out on the enemy as soon as it was cast, then when you came back to camp you'd get a word of praise from Sherman or a handshake from McClellan! But now the generals have become shopkeepers again, and balls of yarn are the deadliest projectiles they're likely to deal with. The future is bleak for artillery in America!"<br><br>"You're right, Bilsby, it's a cruel disappointment!" said Colonel Bloomsberry. "One day you give up your calm, peaceful life, you learn the manual of arms, you leave Baltimore and march off to battle, you fight heroically, and then, two or three years later, you have to lose the fruit of all your efforts and do nothing but stand around idly with your hands in your pockets."<br><br>The valiant colonel would have been unable to dem_onstrate his own idleness in this way, though not from lack of pockets.<br><br>"And no war in sight!" said the famous J. T. Maston, scratching his rubber skull with the iron hook at the end of his arm. "There's not even a cloud on the horizon, and yet there's still so much to be done in the science of artillery! Only this morning I drew up a complete set of plans of a mortar that's destined to change the laws of war!"<br><br>"Really?" said Tom Hunter, involuntarily recalling the test firing of Maston's last creation.<br>"Yes," said Maston. "But what good did it do me to make all those studies and work out all those difficulties? I was only wasting my time. The New World seems determined to live in peace, and the belligerent New York Tribune has begun predicting catastrophes caused by the scandalous growth of the population."<br><br>"But there's always a war going on in Europe to _support the principle of nationality," said Colonel Bloomsberry.<br><br>"What of it?"<br><br>"Well, there might be something for us to do over there, and if our services were accepted . . ."<br><br>"What!" cried Bilsby. "Are you suggesting that we do ballistic research for foreigners?"<br><br>"It would be better than not doing any at all," retorted the colonel.<br><br>"Yes, it would," said J. T. Maston, "but it's out of the question."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"Because in the Old World they have ideas about promotion that are contrary to all our American habits. They think a man can't become a general unless he's first been a second lieutenant, which is the same as saying that you can't be a good gunner unless you've cast the gun yourself! It's . . ."<br>"Ridiculous, that's what it is!" said Tom Hunter, stabbing the arm of his chair with his Bowie knife. "But since that's how things are, there's nothing left for us to do but plant tobacco or distill whale oil!"<br><br>"Do you mean to say," J. T. Maston exclaimed in a ringing voice, "that the last years of our lives will not be devoted to the improvement of firearms? That there will be no new opportunities to test the range of our projectiles? That the air will never again be bright with the flash of our cannons? That there will be no international difficulties which will enable us to declare war on some transatlantic country? That the French will never sink a single one of our steamers, or that the English will never hang any of our citizens in direct violation of the law of nations?"<br><br>"No, Maston," replied Colonel Bloomsberry, "we'll never be that lucky. Not one of those things will happen, and even if one of them did happen, it wouldn't do us any good! Americans are getting less and less touchy all the time. It won't be long before we're a nation of old women!"<br><br>"We're becoming humble," said Bilsby.<br><br>"And we're being humbled!" added Tom Hunter.<br><br>"It's all too true!" J. T. Maston said with renewed vehemence. "There are all kinds of reasons for fighting, but we don't fight! We're intent on saving arms and legs for people who don't know what to do with them! And there's no need to look very far for a reason for going to war. For example, America once belonged to England, didn't it?"<br><br>"Yes, it did," replied Tom Hunter, angrily poking the fire with the end of his crutch.<br><br>"Well, then," said J. T. Maston, "why shouldn't it be England's turn to belong to America?"<br><br>"That would be only fair," said Colonel Bloomsberry.<br><br>"Just go and suggest it to the President!" said J. T. Maston. "You'll see what kind of a reception he'll give you!"<br><br>"It wouldn't be a very polite reception," Bilsby murmured between the four teeth he had saved from battle.<br><br>"I certainly won't vote for him in the next election!" said J. T. Maston.<br><br>"Neither will I!" the bellicose cripples all shouted at once.<br><br>"Meanwhile," said the intrepid J. T. Maston, "if I'm not given a chance to try out my mortar on a real battlefield, I'll resign from the Gun Club and go off into the wilds of Arkansas."<br><br>"And we'll all go with you!" replied the others.<br><br>Things had reached this point, the members of the Gun Club were becoming more and more wrought up, and the club was threatened with dissolution when an unexpected event forestalled that catastrophe.<br><br>The day after the conversation reported above, each member of the club received the following notice:<br>Baltimore, October 3<br><br>The President of the Gun Club has the honor of informing his colleagues that during the meeting on October 5, he will make an announcement that will be of the greatest interest to them. He therefore strongly urges them to be present.<br>Impey Barbicane<br>President<br><i><br>Chapter Two</i><br><br><i><br>President's Barbicane's Announcement<br></i><br>AT EIGHT o'clock on the evening of October 5, a dense crowd was milling in the rooms of the Gun Club at 21 Union Square. All the members who lived in Baltimore had responded to their president's invitation. As for the corresponding members, express trains were bringing them in by the hundreds and they were pouring through the streets of the city. Large though the meeting hall was, it was unable to hold this influx of learned members, and so they overflowed into the adjoining rooms, the halls, and even into the grounds outside. There they encountered the ordinary people who were swarming around the doors, each one trying to make his way to the front, all eager to learn what President Barbicane's important announcement was going to be, pushing, jostling, and crushing one another with the freedom of action that is peculiar to a populace that has been raised with the idea of self-government.<br><br>That evening a stranger in Baltimore would have been unable to enter the meeting hall no matter how much he might have been willing to pay. It was reserved exclusively for the resident and corresponding members of the Gun Club, and no one else was admitted into it. Even the local dignitaries and the members of the city government had to mingle with the crowd and try to catch word of what was taking place inside.</p><h2>Elementary Mathematical Models: Order Aplenty and a Glimpse of Chaos (Mathematical Association of America Textbooks)</h2><p>The language of mathematics has proven over centuries of application to be an indispensable tool for the expression and analysis of real problems. With numerical, graphical, and theoretical methods, this book examines the relevance of mathematical models to phenomena ranging from population growth and economics to medicine and the physical sciences. In a book written for the intelligent and literate non-mathematician, Kalman aims at an understanding of the power and utility of quantitative methods rather than at technical mastery of mathematical operations. He shows first that mathematical models can serve a critical function in understanding the world, and he concludes with a discussion of the problems encountered by traditional algebraic assumptions in chaos theory. Though models can often approximate future events based on existing data and quantitative relationships, Kalman shows that the appearance of regularity and order can often be misleading. By beginning with quantitative models and ending with an introduction to chaos, Kalman offers a broad treatment of both the power and limitations of quantitatively-based predictions.</p><p>The language of mathematics has proven over centuries of application to be an indispensable tool for the expression and analysis of real problems. Here Kalman explains for an audience of non-mathematicians the relevance of mathematical models to phenomena ranging from population growth and economics to medicine and the physical sciences.Dan Kalman has been writing about and teaching mathematics for 20 years.

Its therapeutic approach is based on a purely secular science of nature, with natural laws serving as guidelines for human behavior and medical treatment. No other text offers such broad insights into the thinking and manifest action of the authors of the time. Following an introduction, this volume contains the full original Chinese text of the&nbsp;<i>Ling Shu</i>, an English translation of all eighty-one chapters, and notes on difficult-to-grasp passages and possible changes in the text over time on the basis of Chinese primary and secondary literature of the past two thousand years and translator Paul Unschuld&#x2019;s own work. The&nbsp;<i>Ling Shu</i>&nbsp;reveals itself as a completely rational work, and, in many of its statements, a surprisingly modern one.

Given his importance, it is remarkable that this is the first scholarly work on him in English. </p> <p>Most studies of Lurianic Kabbalah focus on Luria&#x2019;s mythic and speculative ideas or on the ritual and contemplative practices he taught. The central premise of this book is that Lurianic Kabbalah was first and foremost a lived and living phenomenon in an actual social world. Thus the book focuses on Luria the person and on his relationship to his disciples. What attracted Luria&#x2019;s students to him? How did they react to his inspired and charismatic behavior? And what roles did Luria and his students see themselves playing in their collective quest for repair of the cosmos and messianic redemption? </p></p><p>&#x201c;...among the finest works of recent Judaic scholarship.&#x201d;&#x2014;The Forward<br>&#x201c;We come away from this book awed by Fine&#x2019;s scholarship, and with a better understanding of how Rabbi Isaac Luria, who wanted his writings to be concealed after his death, nevertheless produced ideas so powerful that they transformed the nature of Judaism for centuries.&#x201d;&#x2014;San Diego Jewish JournalLawrence Fine is Irene Kaplan Leiwant Professor of Jewish Studies and Professor of Religion at Mount Holyoke College.

An award-winning teacher and nationally respected scholar, she is also an editor for Rowman &amp; Littlefield&#x2019;s Gender Lens Series.Joey Sprague is a major theorist in the field of feminist methodologies and theory, and her work is very accessible to students. The scope of Feminist Methodologies is great for framing why feminist methodologies and feminist theory are necessary in scholarship. (Elizabeth Myers, Smith College)<br><br>This book is a wonderful contribution to the field of feminist methodologies. Sprague does an excellent job of making readers aware of the differences among human populations along the lines of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. Most importantly, this text forces us to think about how marginalized communities have been treated in knowledge production, and how these differences construct the relationship between the researcher and the researched. (Joyce M. Barry, Hamilton College)<br><br>Feminist Methodologies is the best introductory book for teaching research. It&#x2019;s clear, jargon-free, and manages to make complex ideas and concepts&#x2014;many rooted in critical theory&#x2014;accessible for graduate and undergraduate students. I have found this book to be both very useful and simple to understand. (Margo Okazawa-Rey, Fielding Graduate University)<br><br>The first edition of Joey Sprague&#x2019;s book has always been required reading in graduate courses I teach. There simply is no other book like it. The second edition improves on an already exceptional book. This book is a must-read for any critical researcher and, more broadly, any social scientist. The issues of epistemology, methodology, and methods transcend feminist research and should be required reading for anyone concerned with how power and biases shape our understandings of how we build knowledge, as well as influence how we come to understand the world around us. (Tiffany Taylor, Kent State University)<br><br>Previous edition praise: Sprague presents her work in a scholarly manner that is accessible to all readers, regardless of their level of competence in feminist methodologies. Her approach allows readers to think critically about feminist issues and the ways they can contribute to the field in the future. . . As mentioned, it presents a valuable framework for any researcher to use in community-based research.

However, this evidence is only as good as the research methods that were used to generate it. Where do these "facts" come from, and how reliable are they? <br><br><em>Researching Theories of Crime and Deviance</em> offers a critical evaluation of the research methods that generate data, bridging the gap between theory and research in the study of crime and deviant behavior. This unique resource challenges students to carefully appraise--rather than blindly accept--the research techniques that are used to produce theories and scholarship. <br><br>In clear and engaging language, noted criminologists Charis E. Kubrin, Thomas D. Stucky, and Marvin D. Krohn assess the various research methods that have been used to test nine theoretical perspectives of crime. As they examine the processes and challenges of conducting theoretically directed research, the authors focus on sampling, measurement, and analytical issues. Coverage includes:<br><br>* Rational Choice/Deterrence Theory<br>* Trait Theories <br>* Social Disorganization Theory <br>* Anomie/Strain Theory <br>* Social Learning Theory <br>* Social Control Theory <br>* Labeling Theory <br>* Conflict Theory <br>* Integrated Theory <br><br>A dynamic and compelling text, <em>Researching Theories of Crime and Deviance</em> demystifies the research process, encouraging students to become better informed readers and researchers. It serves as an excellent resource for criminological theory courses, graduate-level research methods courses, and seminars that take a close look at the development of criminological theory and/or methods.<br></p><p><br><strong>Charis E.

Hindelang Award.<br><br>"I strongly recommend this book to both students and professional criminologists. The book fills a major gap in the field--the gap between crime theory and crime methods texts. The book focuses on how theories should be tested and it spends much time examining and critiquing the tests that have been done. In particular, the authors present very clear descriptions of each theory, describe the problems/issues that led to revisions in the theory, and present wonderful overviews and critiques of the best and latest research on each theory. All of the major theories are covered, and the book is written in a student friendly manner: each chapter is organized in the same (very logical) way, the authors regularly pose questions for students to consider, they write in a conversational style, and they clearly highlight key points. This book will become a standard text in the field."--Robert Agnew, <em>Emory University</em><p></p><br>"The overall quality of this book is outstanding. It is completely unique. No other theory text offers its combination of clear explanations of major criminological theories, thorough but concise discussions of the testing of each theory, and insightful critiques of the methods used to test these theories. The amount of research reviewed in each chapter is absolutely astounding. The text is clearly written, well organized, and engaging. Reading this book should be mandatory for students, researchers, and theorists."--Ojmarrh Mitchell, <em>University of Cincinnati</em><p></p><br>"This book will be a winner for those of us who see criminology theory as an ever-changing tool for research and policymaking. I'm not aware of any other textbook that unifies the study of theory and theory testing so well."--Bryan Vila, <em>Washington State University</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Suzuki Violin School, Vol 8: Violin Part</h2><p>Teach violin with the popular Suzuki Violin School.

Perched at the edge of the western Roman Empire, northern Britain was not unaffected by the experience, and became swept up in the great tide of processes which gave rise to the early medieval West. Like other places, the country experienced social and ethnic metamorphoses, Christianisation, and colonization by dislocated outsiders, but northern Britain also has its own unique story to tell in the first eight centuries AD.This book is the first detailed political history to treat these centuries as a single period, with due regard for Scotland's position in the bigger story of late Antique transition. From Caledonia to Pictland charts the complex and shadowy processes which saw the familiar Picts, Northumbrians, North Britons and Gaels of early Scottish history become established in the country, the achievements of their foremost political figures, and their ongoing links with the world around them. It is a story that has become much revised through changing trends in scholarly approaches to the challenging evidence, and that transformation too is explained for the benefit of students and general readers.<br></p><p><br><strong>James E.

During that time, it has spread among the neighboring peoples - the Mongol, Himalayan, and Siberian peoples, Manchus and Chinese. At its height is has been practiced in regions as far west as the Volga river and to the east in Beijing. Its capacity for creative adaptation is demonstrated by its recent growth in Europe and America. At the same time, it is at the center of political contestation in ethnically Tibetan regions of China, while its best known exponent, the Dalai Lama, has become one of the most admired religious leaders in the world today. But what does this religion teach? Just what is the position of the Dalai Lama, and how will his succession be assured? Is it true that Tibetan Buddhism in entirely suppressed in China? Scholar Matthew Kapstein offers a brief account responding to these questions and more in this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, in terms that are accessible to students, general readers, journalists, and others who are curious to learn the most essential features of Tibetan Buddhist history, teachings, and practice.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br><br>Oxford's <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

The text's authors, who have won numerous prestigious teaching and research awards, deliver a learning program strong in depth and breadth and current in research and practice that is not found in other products. All content and statistics have been completely updated and include the latest data from the human resource management (HRM) field.<br>The text is divided into five parts:�Part One includes a discussion of the environmental forces that companies face in attempting to capitalize on their human resources as a means to gain competitive advantage.�Part Two deals with the acquisition and preparation of human resources, including human resource (HR) planning and recruitment, selection, and training.�Part Three explores how companies can determine the value of employees and capitalize on their talents through retention and development strategies.�Part Four covers rewarding and compensating human resources, including designing pay structures (Chapter 11), recognizing individual contributions (Chapter 12), and providing benefits (Chapter 13).�Part Five covers special topics in HR management, including labor&#x2013;management relations, international HRM, and strategically managing the HRM function.<br>The edition features outstanding pedagogy:�Updated chapter-opening vignettes contain relevant examples of real-life business problems. Self-assessment exercises ask students to complete and evaluate their skills.&nbsp;�Evidence-Based HR sections highlight the growing trend to demonstrate how human resources contributes to a company' s competitive advantage.&nbsp;�The end-of-chapter segment, A Look Back, encourages students to recall the chapter's opening vignette and apply it to what they have just learned.&nbsp;�Managing People cases look at incidents and real companies and encourage students to critically evaluate each problem and apply the chapter concepts.&nbsp;�Application exercises, such as Click and Drag, video cases, and case analyses, allow students to experience and understand the relevance and application that HRM has to their job and their organization.&nbsp;�Exercising Strategy cases at the end of each chapter pose strategic questions based on real-life practices.�Twenty separate videos provide in-depth detail on topics like bullying, cyberloafing, office romance, and negotiation.&nbsp;�Self-awareness exercises let students dive into more advanced insights about themselves with topics like empathy, leadership, decision-making style, and positivity, while self-assessment exercises help students evaluate their own skills.<br>Unique aspects of this text provide instructional capabilities not found in other texts. For example, students watch real managers apply their years of experience when confronting unscripted issues and later watch follow-up interviews with the managers to view how their responses matched the managers' decisions. Materials provide questions that give students the opportunity to discuss and apply HR concepts to a broad range of issues.</p><p>John R.

A complex system--such as an economy or a tropical ecosystem--consists of interacting adaptive entities that produce dynamic patterns and structures. Diversity plays a different role in a complex system than it does in an equilibrium system, where it often merely produces variation around the mean for performance measures. In complex adaptive systems, diversity makes fundamental contributions to system performance.</p><br><p> Scott Page gives a concise primer on how diversity happens, how it is maintained, and how it affects complex systems. He explains how diversity underpins system level robustness, allowing for multiple responses to external shocks and internal adaptations; how it provides the seeds for large events by creating outliers that fuel tipping points; and how it drives novelty and innovation. Page looks at the different kinds of diversity--variations within and across types, and distinct community compositions and interaction structures--and covers the evolution of diversity within complex systems and the factors that determine the amount of maintained diversity within a system.</p><p> </p><ul><br> <li>Provides a concise and accessible introduction </li><br> <li>Shows how diversity underpins robustness and fuels tipping points </li><br> <li>Covers all types of diversity </li><br> <li>The essential primer on diversity in complex adaptive systems</li><br> </ul><p></p></p><p><p>"Scott Page effectively illustrates the multiplicity of results from diverse aspects of complex systems. While all too many social scientists have tried to focus on making analysis simple, Page points out that this overlooks the great variety of relevant material in our social worlds. I am looking forward to having my students read it in my graduate seminar and encourage others to do so as well."<b>--Elinor Ostrom, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics</b></p><p>"At once clear and precise, Page not only makes a persuasive case for the advantages of diversity in biological, ecological, and social systems alike, but also provides the reader with the analytical tools necessary to engage real-world debates in a rational, even quantitative manner. The result is a valuable primer on a difficult and important subject."<b>--Duncan J. Watts, author of <i>Small Worlds: The Dynamics of Networks between Order and Randomness</i></b></p><p>"Scott Page has performed a remarkable work of synthesis. The concepts of diversity and its implications for performance and growth are common to many fields, especially biology and economics. Page has drawn these illustrations together and shown the common elements and how each field illuminates others."<b>--Kenneth J. Arrow, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics</b></p><p>"Page engagingly seduces readers into rather deep ideas in complex systems, including sophisticated mathematical formulas, by using a relaxed style with lots of examples. Yet the treatment is rigorous."<b>--Simon A. Levin, Princeton University</b></p><p>"One of the book's many strengths is that it draws upon insights from seemingly disconnected areas of research and shows how they can be viewed within a common framework. Page's style is lively and conversational, making challenging subject matter quite readable, but without any sacrifice of rigor.

Historical records are first found in Babylon and Egypt, and after two millennia the arithmetical astronomy of the Babylonians merged with the Greek geometrical approach to culminate in the Almagest of Ptolemy. This legacy was transmitted to the Latin West via Islam, and led to Copernicus's claim that the Earth is in motion. In justifying this Kepler converted astronomy into a branch of dynamics, leading to Newton's universal law of gravity. The book concludes with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century applications of Newton's law, and the first explorations of the universe of stars.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Hoskin </strong>taught History of Astronomy at Cambridge University for thirty years and was head of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science.

Guy Peters provides a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the policy-making process from procedural approaches and policy instruments to in-depth analysis of specific policy issues. The <strong>Eleventh</strong> <strong>Edition </strong>considers how policy has been impacted by recent economic and political developments. Not shying away from the complexity of governmental procedure, Peters ensures that the mechanisms of the policy process are understandable through insightful discussions of topical policy areas.</p><p><p> <b>B. Guy Peters</b> is Maurice Falk Professor of American Government at the University of Pittsburgh. He has written extensively in the areas of public administration and public policy, both for the United States and comparatively. Among his recent publications are the <i>Handbook of Public Administration</i> and <i>The Quest for Control: Politicization of the Public Service</i>.</p>"This is an in-depth yet quite accessible overlook of public policy in the United States...With this updated version, Peters&#x2019; text keeps up with the ever-changing world of American public policy while still giving students the tools to better understand this process." -- Michael E. Bednarczuk<br><br>"American Public Policy delivers its readers a well-organized and highly accessible overview of the field of public policy.

Trautman<br><br>"This text is accessibly written without being overly-simplistic, thorough without being too weighty, and it discusses issues relevant to modern students of American public policy." -- Zach Wilhide<br><br>"Peters&#x2019; text is a comprehensive approach to the process, substance, and context of policymaking. In an era where politics seemingly trumps the study of policy as an academic field, Peters shows his reader the technical aspects of policymaking and the theories underlying policy decisions. At the same time, Peters makes the topics approachable to students from many personal and academic backgrounds." -- Andrea M.

To contain secrets, American and Soviet leaders created plutopias--communities of nuclear families living in highly-subsidized, limited-access atomic cities. Fully employed and medically monitored, the residents of Richland and Ozersk enjoyed all the pleasures of consumer society, while nearby, migrants, prisoners, and soldiers were banned from plutopia--they lived in temporary "staging grounds" and often performed the most dangerous work at the plant. Brown shows that the plants' segregation of permanent and temporary workers and of nuclear and non-nuclear zones created a bubble of immunity, where dumps and accidents were glossed over and plant managers freely embezzled and polluted. In four decades, the Hanford plant near Richland and the Maiak plant near Ozersk each issued at least 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment--equaling four Chernobyls--laying waste to hundreds of square miles and contaminating rivers, fields, forests, and food supplies. Because of the decades of secrecy, downwind and downriver neighbors of the plutonium plants had difficulty proving what they suspected, that the rash of illnesses, cancers, and birth defects in their communities were caused by the plants' radioactive emissions. Plutopia was successful because in its zoned-off isolation it appeared to deliver the promises of the American dream and Soviet communism; in reality, it concealed disasters that remain highly unstable and threatening today. <br><br>An untold and profoundly important piece of Cold War history, <em>Plutopia</em> invites readers to consider the nuclear footprint left by the arms race and the enormous price of paying for it.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kate Brown</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the author of <em>A Biography of No Place: From Ethnic Borderland to Soviet Heartland</em>, winner of the American Historical Association's George Louis Beer Prize.

Athearn Prize of the Western History Association <br><p></p><br>"Turning up a surprising amount of hitherto hidden material and talkative survivors, Brown writes a vivid, often hair-raising history of the great plutonium factories and the privileged cities built around them... Readers will squirm to learn of the high radiation levels workers routinely experienced and the casualness with which wastes poured into the local air, land and rivers... An angry but fascinating account of negligence, incompetence and injustice justified (as it still is) in the name of national security." --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"An unflinching and chilling account." --<em>Seattle Times</em><p></p><br>"Harrowing... Meticulously researched... <em>Plutopia</em> has important messages for those managing today's nuclear facilities, arguing for caution and transparency." --<em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"The book tells two intertwined stories. One is an appalling narrative of environmental disasters... The second narrative is about the towns, the townspeople, and the creation of a spatially segmented landscape that enabled those disasters... This is admirable comparative history." --Carl Abbott, <em>Environmental History</em><p></p><br>"Fascinating." -- <em>Dissent</em><p></p><br>"One of the Cold War's more striking perversities never made it to public view. ... Brown is a good writer, and she describes with precision the construction of the two sites (a difficult process in the U.S. case, an unbelievably horrid one in the Russian case), the hazardous occupations undertaken by their inhabitants, and the consciously contrived bubbles of socioeconomic inequality both places became." --<em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"Brown's account is unique, partisan and occasionally personal in that she includes some of her thoughts about interviews she conducted... But because she is open and thorough about her sources, those are strengths to be celebrated, not weaknesses to be deplored. It also means her book is engaging, honest and, in the end, entirely credible." --<em>New Scientist</em><p></p><br>"An amazing book... Brown found many parallels between Richland and Ozersk that disrupt the conservative Cold War dichotomy between the 'free world' and the totalitarian one. Her research included not only uncovering previously secret documents in both countries but also tracking down and interviewing old-time residents of Ozersk and Richland. Her picture of the treatment of plutonium workers on both sides of the Iron Curtain is enough to make you gnash your teeth or cry." --Jon Wiener, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Arresting, engagingly narrated...

Roulac, <em>New York Journal of Books</em><p></p><br>"<em>Plutopia</em> is reporting and research at its best, both revealing a hidden history and impacting the important discussions about nuclear power that should be happening today." --Glenn Dallas, <em>San Francisco Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"An untold and profoundly important piece of Cold War history, <em>Plutopia</em> invites readers to consider the nuclear footprint left by the arms race and the enormous price of paying for it." --<em>H-Soyuz</em> <br><p></p><br>"Kate Brown has written a provocative and original study of two cities -- one American, one Soviet -- at the center of their countries' nuclear weapons complexes. The striking parallels she finds between them help us -- impel us -- to see the Cold War in a new light. <em>Plutopia</em> will be much discussed. It is a fascinating and important book." --David Holloway, author of <em>Stalin and the Bomb</em><p></p><br>"Kate Brown has produced a novel and arresting account of the consequences of Cold War Nuclear policies on both sides of the Iron Curtain. Interweaving documentary research in government archives, reviews and revisions of the public record, and a host of personal interviews with the citizens -- perpetrators, victims, and witnesses -- Brown's <em>Plutopia</em> makes a lasting contribution to the continuing chronicle of the human and environmental disasters of the atomic age." --Peter Bacon Hales, author of <em>Atomic Spaces: Living on the Manhattan Project</em><p></p><br>"It may be the best piece of research and writing in the nuclear history field in the last 25 years - perhaps the best ever...

It tells of the knight Artegall's efforts to rid Faerie Land of tyranny and injustice, aided by his sidekick Talus and the timely intervention of his betrothed, the woman warrior Britomart. As allegory, Book Five figures forth ideal concepts of justice and explores how justice may be applied in a real world complicated by social inequality, female rule, political guile, and excessive violence. At the same time, as historical allegory, it retells a number of the most important events of early modern England, in particular the controversies surrounding the colonization of Ireland. An integral part of the larger poem, Book Five also stands on its own as one of the most challenging meditations on justice in English literature.</p></p><p><p>Abraham Stoll is Assistant Professor of English, University of San Diego.</p><p>This edition of book 5 of <i>The Faerie Queene</i> is a welcome contribution. Stoll presents a text that will be very useful in the classroom. The decision to make available individual (or in two cases, paired) books of the romance will make it possible for instructors to teach their preferred books of the romance; Stoll's edition of book 5 will certainly increase the likelihood that the Legend of Justice will reappear in undergraduate classrooms, introducing students to a text in which Spenser scholars are increasingly interested. We will all benefit from that. --Andrew Fleck, <i>Sixteenth Century Journal</i></p><br><br><p>Two editions of Spenser are both from the same series, published by Hackett Publishing Company, which is providing inexpensive paperback volumes of <i>The Faerie Queene</i>, under the general editorship of Abraham Stoll. The volumes printed this year, books 1 and 5, are edited, respectively, by Carol V. Kaske and Stoll himself. A single volume combining books 3 and 4, edited by Dorothy Stephens, is forthcoming, as is book 6, edited by Andrew Hadfield. The volumes are attractively printed, with notes at the bottom of the page. Each volume includes an introduction, the <i>Letter to Raleigh</i>, a brief 'Life of Edmund Spenser,' textual notes, a glossary, an 'Index of Characters,' and a bibliography. Kaske's introduction to book 1 forms an accessible student guide, touching on a wide range of topics, from versification, genre, and allegory, to 'Spenser's Religious Milieu.' At the same time, there are fresh flashes of insight, no doubt derived from Kaske's long experience of teaching a complex poem. . . . Eschewing 'political and biographical allegory (p. xvi), the notes offer plenty of help to the student seeking to get behind the veil of Spenser's dark conceit, for they emphasize symbolism and historical context, especially literary context or 'sources.' Stoll's edition of book 5 of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> includes a judicious introduction of considerable merit. Not simply well written and learned, it partitions the information in an accessible and interesting way. Stoll is fully attuned to the recent controversies surrounding the Legend of Justice, but he does more than record them for the student reader; he manages to express sympathy for both poet and poem. Students need to hear the historical nature of Spenser's achievement for English literature, and Stoll leads nicely with this topic: book 5 is 'one of the most challenging meditations on justice in English literature' (p. ix). Stoll is as sensitive to the violence of book 5 as he is to its strangeness and beauty. Students will appreciate the short inventory of important works of criticism at the end of each section. The notes are not as full as Kaske's, but perhaps appropriately so. . . . I look forward to having access to the remaining volumes in this series. --Patrick Cheney, <i>Studies in English Literature 1500-1900</i></p></p><h2>Computer Ethics</h2><p><p>Written in clear, accessible prose,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Fourth edition of <i>Computer Ethics</i> </i> brings together philosophy, law, and technology.

As westerners transitioned from subsistence to market economies, and wrestled with frontier and conservation-versus-preservation ideologies, they ultimately arrived at a present characterized by climate change and sustainability challenges. As Dant concludes, the complex symbiotic relationship between humans and the environment demonstrates that there is no pristine myth to which we should strive to return; the West as "Eden" has always been a false illusion and it is time to lose it once and for all.<b>Sara Dant</b> is Professor and Chair of History at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, whose work focuses on environmental politics in the United States with a particular emphasis on the creation and development of consensus and bi-partisanism.

It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of <i>SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</i>. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is "transparent" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique "tunneling" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.Written for a wide, technical audience, <i>SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</i> covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you're an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.No matter where or how you're shipping information, <i>SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</i> will show you how to do it securely.</p></p><p>The suite of utility applications that Unix users and administrators find indispensable--Telnet, rlogin, FTP, and the rest--can in fact prove to be the undoing of interconnected systems. The Secure Shell, a.k.a. SSH (which isn't a true shell at all) provides your otherwise attack-prone utilities with the protection they need. <i>SSH: The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</i> explains how to use SSH at all levels. In a blended sequence, the book explains what SSH is all about, how it fits into a larger security scheme, and how to employ it as an everyday user with an SSH client. More technically detailed chapters show how to configure a SSH server--several variants are covered--and how to integrate SSH with non-Unix client platforms. <p> As befits its detail- and variation-rich subject, this book comprises many specialized sections, each dealing with some specific aspect of use or configuration (setting up access control at the account level, for example, or generating keys for a particular SSH server). The writing is both informative and fun to read; the authors switch back and forth between text and entry-and-response listings from SSH machines. They often run through a half-dozen or more variants on the same command in a few pages, providing the reader with lots of practical information. The discussion of how SSH fits into a Kerberos Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is great, as is the advice on defeating particular kinds of attacks. <i>--David Wall</i></p> <p> <b>Topics covered:</b> </p> <ul> <li>The Secure Shell (SSH) for installers, administrators, and everyday users </li> <li>SSH design and operation </li> <li>Server setup </li> <li>SSH agents </li> <li>Client configuration </li> <li>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) integration </li> <li>SSH1 </li> <li>SSH2 </li> <li>F-Secure </li> <li>OpenSSH for Unix </li> <li>SSH1 and SecureCRT for Microsoft Windows </li> <li>NiftyTelnet SSH for Mac OS</li> </ul><p>Daniel J.

Taking as his starting point the collapse of the medieval world, Gillespie argues that from the very beginning moderns sought not to eliminate religion but to support a new view of religion and its place in human life. He goes on to explore the ideas of such figures as William of Ockham, Petrarch, Erasmus, Luther, Descartes, and Hobbes, showing that modernity is best understood as a series of attempts to formulate a new and coherent metaphysics or theology.</p> <p>&#x201c;Bringing the history of political thought up to date and situating it against the backdrop of contemporary events, Gillespie&#x2019;s analyses provide us a way to begin to have conversations with the Islamic world about what is perhaps the central question within each of the three monotheistic religions: if God is omnipotent, then what is the place of human freedom?&#x201d;&#x2014;Joshua Mitchell, Georgetown University</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Michael Allen Gillespie </b>is the Jerry G. and Patricia Crawford Hubbard Professor of Political Science in Trinity College of Arts and Sciences and professor of philosophy at Duke University. He is the author of <i>Hegel, Heidegger, and the Ground of History</i>, and <i>Nihilism before Nietzsche</i>, both published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>"This book is an excellent complement to Charles Taylor's <i>A Secular Age</i> and a powerful counterpoint to Mark Lilla's <i>The Stillborn God</i>. All three hold that the story of modern philosophy is both superficial and hollow if its theological/metaphysical components are denied. Highly recommended." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Theological Origins of Modernity</i> is not just informative; it is insightfully recuperative as well&#x2014;helping us to understand ourselves better in the present. Though Gillespie only reaches our contemporary situation in his last chapter, we might hope that, incomplete as it unavoidably is, that chapter might form the nucleus of a successor work. At the end of his current book we are more than assured that Gillespie is up to the task." (Stephen A. Erickson <i>Review of Politics</i>)<br><br>"In this rich and dense book, [Gillespie] is self-consciously trying to correct the 'standard' understanding of the origin of modernity. Rather than being the 'victory of secularism,' modernity, he says, is a series of attempts to grapple with fundamental theological issues."

Khaled El-Rouayheb argues that this apparent paradox is based on the anachronistic assumption that homosexuality is a timeless, self-evident fact to which a particular culture reacts with some degree of tolerance or intolerance.

On the one hand, Arabic love poetry, biographical works, and bawdy satires suggest that homosexuality was a visible and tolerated part of Arab-Islamic elite culture before the nineteenth century. On the other hand, Islam supposedly considers homosexuality an abomination and prescribes severe punishment for it. <br><br>In <i>Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World, 1500&#x2013;1800,</i> Khaled El-Rouayheb shows that this apparent paradox is based on the anachronistic assumption that homosexuality is a timeless, self-evident fact to which a particular culture reacts with some degree of tolerance or intolerance. Drawing on poetry, belles lettres, biographical literature, medicine, physiognomy, dream interpretation, and Islamic legal, mystical, and homiletic texts, he shows that the culture of the period lacked the concept of homosexuality. Instead, paramount importance was given to distinctions that are not captured by that term&#x2014;between active and passive sexual roles, between passionate infatuation and lust, and between penetrative and nonpenetrative intercourse.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first book-length treatment on the perceptions and evaluations of male homoeroticism in premodern Arab-Islamic culture, this book will become a welcome and frequently referred to addition to the bookshelves of readers interested in the history of sexuality, Islamic history, Arabic literature, gay and lesbian studies, and the history of ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><p><b>Khaled El-Rouayheb</b> is assistant professor of Islamic intellectual history in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University.</p><br><br></p><h2>New Hart&#39;s Rules: The Oxford Style Guide</h2><p>For over a hundred years, <em>Hart's Rules </em>has been the authority on style, helping writers and editors prepare copy for publication.

Haunted by the mistakes of her past, and lacking any self-belief, her only comfort seems to come from the imaginary conversations she has with Paul Newman, and the characters he played. But as life crawls on and she finds work, small acts of kindness start to reveal themselves to her, and slowly the chance of a new life begins to emerge. Full of memorable characters and imbued with a beautiful sense of yearning, <i>Northline</i> is an extraordinary portrait of contemporary America from a writer and musician whose work has been lauded as "mournful, understated, and proudly steeped in menthol smoke and bourbon" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>). </p></p><p>Willy Vlautin is the author of <em>The Free</em>, <em>Lean on Pete</em>, <em>Northline</em>, <em>The Motel Life</em>, and <em>Don't Skip Out on Me</em>. He is the singer and songwriter of the band Richmond Fontaine and a member of the band The Delines. He lives outside Portland, Oregon.<p></p><p> Willy Vlautin's Northline tells the story of Allison Johnson, a young, pregnant woman who leaves her abusive neo-Nazi boyfriend, goes to Reno, sells her baby and tries to get her life in order by working at a casino. She's a pathetic case, a blackout drunk who never does anything mean to anyone but gets taken advantage of frequently. Still, she meets a number of people who help her out, and she finally hooks up with a kindred soul, someone as hapless as she.</p><p></p><p>Vlautin's other characters are not high-rollers. They're Allison's sweaty apartment superintendent, a kindly truck-stop waitress, deformed casino nighthawks, a compassionate truck driver whose child has been killed, drunks, janitors and Mexican-hating skinheads. Like Dagoberto Gilb and Marc Watkins, Vlautin shows us people who, if they have jobs at all, do the dirty work, scratching out livings in the depths of society.</p><p>In an interview appended to Northline, Vlautin claims Steinbeck as his primary literary influence, and it shows. Like his mentor, Vlautin has no truck with subtleties, and his literary machinery often groans like a rusted Model T. For instance, when Vlautin senses that the reader needs to get into Allison's head, he provides her with a notepad so she can write confessional notes to herself (and us). </p><p></p><p>What redeems Vlautin's work is that his objective isn't to produce belles lettres, but to tell the stories of America's underclass, as he did in his first novel, The Motel Life. The brutal events that are so frequent for his characters are rendered with chilling nonchalance. When Allison is raped, beaten and left injured and handcuffed to her boyfriend's bed, Vlautin reports the facts as if they are just everyday occurrences. After Allison passes out drunk in a bathroom while having sex with her boyfriend, Vlautin writes, "He looked at her, at the blood again leaking, dripping from the cut. He saw the small pool of urine around her, and he kicked her. Just once, but as hard as he could, with his steel-toed boots. Kicked her in the leg, above the knee. Still she didn't move, so he reached down for her clothes and began dressing her."</p><p></p><p>That's the kind of life Allison lives. Willy Vlautin tells her story with unrelenting clarity, and although the novel ends with her at relative peace, the next day is likely to deliver another disaster. Northline serves as a reminder that America's beaten, broke and miserable are not necessarily morally bankrupt or clueless victims. They're just trying to get by on minimal resources, little education and a bit of hope.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

As a loyal subject to King George, Cresswell found himself often unhappy in America, detailing the turmoil and abuses often suffered by Loyalists in the colonies. Confining his travel mainly to the mid-Atlantic region, Cresswell not only had occasion to attend a slave gathering and observe what went on there, but also traded amongst many of the native tribes, including the Lenape, Tuscarora, Ottawa and Shawnee. Despite his ambivalence about returning to England, (toward the end of the book he moans, &#34;&#34;I wish to be at home and yet dread the thought of returning to my native Country a Beggar &#34;&#34; (P. 251)), life in the colonies becomes too much for this loyal subject and Cresswell&#39;s journal ends in 1777 with his return to England.</p><p>1750-1804</p><h2>Luthor (DC Black Label Edition)</h2><p><b>Superman has been called many things--the defender of truth, justice and the American way; the Big Blue Boy Scout; and the Man of Steel.

Vollmann tells the story of the epic fighting retreat of the Nez Perce Indians, with flashbacks to the Civil War. <br> &nbsp;<br> Defrauded and intimidated at every turn, the Nez Perces finally went on the warpath in 1877, subjecting the U.S. Army to its greatest defeat since Little Big Horn the previous year, as they fled from northeast Oregon across Montana to the Canadian border. Vollmann&#x2019;s main character is not the legendary Chief Joseph but his pursuer, General Oliver Otis Howard, the brave, shy, tormented, devoutly Christian Civil War veteran. In this novel, we see him as commander, father, son, husband, friend, and killer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Teeming with many vivid characters on both sides of the conflict, and written in an original style in which the printed page works as a stage with multiple layers of foreground and background, <i>The Dying Grass</i> is another mesmerizing achievement from one of the most ambitious writers of our time.</p><p>William T.

They call him original, unusual, unsound, SATANic, a true American. That means he&#x2019;s fixing to die. He&#x2019;s still revising his poem &#x201c;Old War-Dreams.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;ve ever seen him scribbling away with his superannuated hands, you&#x2019;ll know our nineteenth century&#x2019;s nearly gone. The twentieth&#x2019;s going to be twice as good. That&#x2019;s why I wish Walt could wake up from his war-dreams, which are grey and disappointingly dark, like so much Wyoming jade: Long have they pass&#x2019;d, faces and trenches and fields, but no more of that, where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure, or away from the fallen; no more, a solid dozen years after we&#x2019;ve saved our Union, why not keep facing forward? Let us comb away the relics from Walt&#x2019;s fields, fill in his trenches with marble monuments, and enshroud those faces (skeleton-visages all) with the thick white juice of Indian hemp. Long have they pass&#x2019;d; so let them. Walt&#x2019;s sadness may have grown as long as his white beard, but he fights it; he votes straight Optimism ticket; as for me, I&#x2019;d wish all sadness away, because our Republic&#x2019;s now superior to a hundred years old! In the next generation we&#x2019;ll annex Canada, I&#x2019;ll bet.<br><br> The retired colonel beside me would rather finish the job in Mexico first. Also, he&#x2019;s mortified about Little Big Horn. That&#x2019;s why he wants to enlarge the Army.&#x2014;So sorry; it&#x2019;s going the other way.&#x2014; I can see myself in each of the metal buttons of his drab-hued vest. And before us all the President-elect shines white-linened at wrist, neck and breast! His long narrow white face, eminently suited for being printed on paper money, his tapering beard, sunken eyes, bushy brows, distinguished temples and cliff-like forehead make of him such a statesman of the drum-corps that I cannot begrudge him either of his inaugurations (the first took place secretly just last Sunday). Up behind him broods his majestic wife&#x2014;Lemonade Lucy, they call her; her dream is to outlaw booze and cleavage at the White House. She&#x2019;s as shiny, solid, heavy and comforting as a Colt Model 1873. O, and who could miss Dan Sickles? He&#x2019;s the one-legged general with the scowl and the moustache whose telegrams to four Southern states gained our candidate the victory even after he&#x2019;d conceded. May the best trickster win! Long have they pass&#x2019;d, so why can&#x2019;t we finally count ourselves permanently pacified? They say he&#x2019;s going to pull our troops out of the South. I say a standing army&#x2019;s un-American. The colonel&#x2019;s old enough to believe anything; I won&#x2019;t pick on him&#x2014;but let the fools out West take care of themselves. We took care of our own Indians. We did what we had to and went home.&#x2014; Howbeit, our President-elect, who&#x2019;s ever more grandly put together by the instant, I do confess, swore so sweetly upon his Bible just now that I fell in love with Government all over again! He&#x2019;s a walking compromise, by GOD; he won two days ago by a single electoral vote.<br><br> It might have been the most American campaign ever. The dark horse from Ohio came in at an easy canter on the homestretch, beating the favorite of the field by a full length and a half. I read that in the Louisville Courier-Journal last June. And now that dark horse is President! Praise the LORD and Dan Sickles. I&#x2019;ll never forget how the dark horse (a dark brown hackney, let&#x2019;s say) glared warily above his long beard, while William Wheeler, his Vice President, looked ever so sad, sulky and handsome. As for the opponents, Tilden was a chubby-cheeked, glib smiler, and his Vice President, Hendricks, appeared to be a Puritan with a secret. Even though Tilden&#x2019;s machine harvested two hundred and fifty-one thousand more votes than ours, long have they pass&#x2019;d, because after the dark horse cantered sadly back to his paddock where Lemonade Lucy waited with the currying-brush, Dan Sickles, expert in gelding thoroughbreds, sent a basketful of late-night telegrams, with horse-racing tips attached. Republicans in South Carolina kept out the Democrats by force and refused to tally the returns of two counties. Hurrah! Louisiana would have gone for Hayes anyhow, I hear. Florida would have gone for Tilden. Had Oregon recognized her one Democratic elector, Tilden would have nibbled up that vote. But then I guess we might have annexed more Indians and turned them Republican! If this is too complicated for you, just remember a dark horse from Ohio, then the Electoral Commission&#x2019;s decision to let sleeping dogs lie, followed by the Democratic filibuster, the recess, Stevens&#x2019;s midnight call upon Bradley, who then decided not to count the Democratic votes, although Stevens might never have visited Bradley, who likewise might not have sold his influence, since some events do occur purely as a result of prayer; and we all lived happily ever after, thanks to the equivocal &#x201c;Wormley Agreements.&#x201d; Land of the Pilgrims&#x2019; pride, land where wet greenbacks dried; from every mountain side let freedom ring.<br><br> And don&#x2019;t say freedom comes free. The Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad expects a handout now. Tennessee had better get the Postmaster Generalship. The South will endure another Republican administration, but no more Northern despotism, if you please! That&#x2019;s why they made the dark horse whinny out a promise to bring our soldiers home from Louisiana and South Carolina; you can wager your last dollar he won&#x2019;t stop there. And you know what, brother? It&#x2019;s all the same to me how they do things in Louisiana. We won the war and now let&#x2019;s go home.*<br><br>Our President-elect surely is a treat. Last year he was as green as a soldier&#x2019;s coffee beans. Now I can almost remember his name: Rutherford B. Hayes.&#x2014; Another wounded war hero!&#x2014; He&#x2019;s going to be a one-termer, because compromisers can&#x2019;t please anybody. How could he ever approach Dan Sickles, who&#x2019;s so famous that he once granted himself the privilege of donating a bone from his amputated leg to a museum? All the same, I enjoy him. He makes sad allusion to the two distinct races whose peculiar relations to each other have brought upon us the deplorable complications and perplexities which exist in these States. The retired colonel shakes his weary head at that, and I throw him a wink, for we both know exactly what complications and which perplexities. Now he and I have something in common! For what do we care about that other race? Didn&#x2019;t we bleed enough for them? I lost my son at Chancellorsville. Yes, sir. I keep his tintype right here in my pocket. That&#x2019;s Elias when he was sixteen. His chin takes after mine, but his eyes favor his mother&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;s one of thousands who paid for General Howard&#x2019;s negligence. My wife&#x2019;s never been the same. Some folks blame Hooker, but I say Howard should have done more than send out a handful of GODd&#x2014;&#x2014; d pickets. And now the man&#x2019;s a brigadier general. I used to get apopletic on the subject of Howard, but, you know, long have they pass&#x2019;d, so let &#x2019;em rot alone in their unmarked graves. Actually, I guess they mean to give them decent monuments now, or so I&#x2019;ve heard. I rode out there in &#x2019;67, just to try to understand that battle with my eyes, and a one-legged fellow said to me: Here&#x2019;s where the Secceshes came bursting through. We had no warning until dozens of deer rushed out from the trees. Our boys were stretched out along the Plank Road and the Orange Turnpike, down there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2014; Well, then we got friendly. I showed him Elias&#x2019;s tintype and he showed me his stump. We agreed: Nobody could have held that line. Stonewall Jackson took his fatal wound just past that ruined chimney, they say. I wish I could have seen that villain go down! And Howard&#x2019;s tent was up there, and him with his nose in a hymnal most likely. He faced most of our guns south&#x2014;as if the enemy couldn&#x2019;t go around! That wasn&#x2019;t enough; he also gave away a brigade to Dan Sickles. They should have court-martialed him. I understand he retreated to that cemetery on the hill. Nobody can say where Elias fell, of course. I couldn&#x2019;t find any of his comrades. He kept to himself, that boy; he didn&#x2019;t make friends easily, not that people had anything against him, either. He was two days short of his nineteenth birthday. I guarantee that he didn&#x2019;t have much use for our Christian General. In one letter he wrote us, he put down that in Howard&#x2019;s hearing you couldn&#x2019;t say a word against the niggers. The way I look at it, when the Government calls on you to shed your blood, you&#x2019;ve earned the right to speak your mind. And when you&#x2019;re forbidden to call a man tyrant, doesn&#x2019;t that make him one? Elias saw an officer drummed right out of the Army just for disagreeing with the idea of Emancipation. Don&#x2019;t mistake me; I wouldn&#x2019;t oppose it myself; I just don&#x2019;t trouble my appetite about it. Let the President-elect take care of his two distinct races; niggers are citizens now in all thirty-eight states of this Union; well, that&#x2019;s hardly my lookout; I don&#x2019;t see many niggers in Connecticut. (Just the other day, that old Walt Whitman remarked to me: I can myself almost remember negro slaves in New York State, as my grandfather and great-grandfather own&#x2019;d a number.) Well, that General Howard&#x2019;s just crazy for darkies, apparently. Now it&#x2019;s come out that he embezzled Government funds on their behalf. And there&#x2019;s the real reason I&#x2019;m in favor of shrinking down the Army: I want Howard cashiered. That won&#x2019;t bring Elias back, but perhaps it&#x2019;ll give me satisfaction. And Rutherford B. Hayes stands (if he stands for anything) for convivial contraction. To hell with war-dreams new and old; out with Howard! Just as in the Buffalo Country, so I hear, Crows will pull Dakota corpses off their tree-platforms and explode their guns right up against them, so I aim to blow up all my old sadnesses if I can, and live forever free from corpses. Therefore, my fellow Americans, even though I was a Tilden man, and Tilden got robbed, I&#x2019;ll sit here grinning and clapping all the way to the evening adjournment, the Congressmen flashing away on their dark horses, the dome of the Capitol shining overhead like a half-moon.<br><i><br> WILLIAM THE BLIND.<br> Washington, D.C., 1877.<br></i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>GRASS-TEXT II</i><br> &nbsp;<br> And so the President-elect strides into the Senate chamber to say: The permanent pacification, as sharp and straight as a train&#x2019;s shadow, of the country, just as a brave man goes ahead to mark quicksand with sharpened poles so that Posterity can safely ford the river, upon such principles and by such measures as will secure the complete protection of all its citizens, even the ones at the Old Market in Saint Louis, in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights, O, don&#x2019;t remind me, is now the one subject in our public affairs, which all thoughtful and patriotic citizens regard as of supreme importance. What these principles are I don&#x2019;t remember (the colonel ought to, since he&#x2019;s a distinguished Indian fighter); as for the measures, let&#x2019;s call them simply continual and energetic. Hurrah for seven American dreams!<br><br> So let us fall asleep (ain&#x2019;t our President sominiferous?) and dream to death the golden-grassed camas prairies out West, so that we can pacify them, permanently, and upon such principles, &amp; c, &amp; c.

How do they pray? What&#x2019;s it like to go on pilgrimage to Mecca? What rituals accompany the birth of a child, a wedding, or the death of a loved one? What holidays do Muslims celebrate and what charities do they support? How do they learn about the Qur&#x2019;an? </p><p>The Practice of Islam in America introduces readers to the way Islam is lived in the United States, offering vivid portraits of Muslim American life passages, ethical actions, religious holidays, prayer, pilgrimage, and other religious activities. It takes readers into homes, religious congregations, schools, workplaces, cemeteries, restaurants&#x2014;and all the way to Mecca&#x2014;to understand the diverse religious practices of Muslim Americans. </p><p>Going beyond a theoretical discussion of what Muslims are supposed to do, this volume focuses on what they actually do. As the volume reveals, their religious practices are shaped by their racial and ethnic identity, their gender and sexual orientation, and their sectarian identity, among other social factors. Readers gain practical information about Islamic religion while also coming to understand how the day-to-day realities of American life shape Muslim American practice.</p></p><p><p><b>Edward E.

Of his latest novel, Newsday wrote, &#34;Thomas King has quietly and gorgeously done it again.&#34; Truth and Bright Water tells of a summer in the life of Tecumseh and Lum, young Native-American cousins coming of age in the Montana town of Truth, and the Bright Water Reserve across the river in Alberta. It opens with a mysterious woman with a suitcase, throwing things into the river -- then jumping in herself. Tecumseh and Lum go to help, but she and her truck have disappeared. Other mysteries puzzle Tecumseh: whether his mom will take his dad back; if his rolling-stone aunt is home to stay; why no one protects Lum from his father&#39;s rages. Then Tecumseh gets a job helping an artist -- Bright Water&#39;s most famous son -- with the project of a lifetime. As Truth and Bright Water prepare for the Indian Days festival, their secrets come together in a climax of tragedy, reconciliation, and love.</p><p>A masterful tale that combines the wit of Sherman Alexie with the old-fashioned storytelling of Olive Ann Burns.When Tecumseh and older cousin Lum witness a woman throwing a suitcase from a cliff into the Shield River, and then following it with herself, the small mysteries begin. The body is found, the suitcase not. Then Soldier, Tecumseh's dog and best friend, finds a child's skull with a hole and a red ribbon. Son of a practical mother and a dreaming, sometimes drinking, mostly scheming father, Tecumseh lives in the contemporary flux made up of the two towns of Truth and Brightwater, one in Montana and one in Canada-and one an Indian reservation-separated by the glacial Shield River. He also lives in his own flux between childhood and adulthood, and in another between his separated parents. Dad augments his living as a carpenter, with schemes no odder than the government's-smuggling hazardous bio-waste across the border, for example-and Mom's a beautician. During the long days of summer, Tecumseh wanders back and forth between them, Soldier nearly always at his side. Lum is his second best friend, a top-flight runner in training for the contest that will cap the annual end-of-summer Indian Days Festival. Tecumseh's aunt, Cassie, makes one of her many returns, but this time, mysteriously, she doesn't leave (together, she and Mom carry a multitude of secrets). Also returning is Monroe Swimmer, Famous Indian Artist, the reservation's most notable son and once a close friend of Tecumseh's father. Tecumseh takes a "job" with Monroe, who has bought the old Methodist church and is painting it-a magical trompe l'oeil-into oblivion. As mysteries unfold, so does a loving portrait of small-town life, both on and off the reservation, but not in the way we're accustomed to seeing in contemporary Native American fiction: King (Green Grass, Running Water, 1993), more interested in being human first and Indian second, accomplishes his aims without "characters" of mystic eccentricity, violent guilt, racism and self-loathing, and alcoholism being upfront and center. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this winning bildungsroman, King (Green Grass, Running Water) demonstrates once again his extraordinarily moving vision of contemporary Native America. The book follows the relationship between two boys, narrator Tecumseh and Lum, and the story, set in motion by a mystery, takes place among Blackfoot Indians living on the U.S./Canadian border in two towns separated by the Shield river (Truth is in Montana, and Bright Water is on an Ottawa Indian reservation). The youths witness a woman dump the contents of a suitcase off a river bluff and then jump into the abyss herself, but by the time they get to the spot, she's nowhere to be seen. Other mysteries are created by significant homecomings: Tecumseh's free-spirited, world-traveling Aunt Cassie is in town, but no one will tell Tecumseh why; and "famous Indian artist" Monroe Swimmer buys the old mission church on the reservation and moves in. Swimmer is a trickster who paints his hilltop abode in trompe l'oeil clouds and sky and sets artificial buffalo around it, so that to the naked eye below, it's almost invisible. Closer in tone to King's debut, Medicine River, than to the antics of Green Grass, Running Water, this book exhibits the author's keen powers of observation and captures the essence of reservation life with dark humor and cutting satire. But the wry humor mediates and belies desperation, with 15-year-old Tecumseh fixated on getting his mother to reconcile with his dreamy but shiftless father. All plots come together, some in tragedy, and all mysteries are solved as Indian Days approaches. This sharp-edged novel is also King's sweetest; there's plenty of magic, yet it's also his most realistic book thus far. Readers familiar with King's work will revel in it, while new readers will discover his extraordinary narrative power. Agent, Lisa Bankoff, ICM.

Mr. Quilt shows you how to create a masterpiece, from choosing the right fabrics for an authentic Art Deco look to estimating yardage, cutting fabric and planning your piecing.</p><p>Don Linn lives in Redding, California, with his wife and high school sweetheart, Donna. He and Donna have a grown son and daughter who also live in California. Since childhood, Don has loved to make things and to work with his hands. His first sewing projects involved automobile upholstery and making clothes for himself and his wife while in college. Don had an entire career working in various manufacturing facilities as a draftsman. It was here that he dealt with a wide array of geometric shapes while doing machine design work before returning to college. After college he worked in upper management in both the forest products industry and the precast concrete industry. During this time he drew upon his experience as a draftsman in designing machinery and doing production drawings. Don&#39;s journey in quilting began after a corporate downsizing. He started out with a longarm machine and not a clue how to operate it. Since then, he has taught himself how to machine quilt, design, and piece quilts. He is now a well-known teacher of machine quilting and piecing classes.In olden days a glimpse of stocking Was looked on as something shocking, But now, God knows, Anything goes. Cole Porter This verse aptly describes the general attitude of most people during the twenties and thirties, according to Don Linn in Design Art Deco Quilts. During that time, between the two world wars, designers worked in two diverse schools of thought. One area of design was in the use of florals; nearly all of these designs were highly stylized or abstract. The other school concentrated on making designs clean and uncluttered as a way of divorcing themselves from the preceding art nouveau era. Mass production was becoming commonplace. Some referred to these designs as machine arts. Other designs attempted to capture the futuristic streamlined look of what was yet to come. Here one would see more flowing lines as the designers tried to capture the feeling of flowing motion in their work. Now readers can make a bold artistic statement with their own one-of-a-kind Art Deco quilt. Linn shows readers how to create masterpieces in Design Art Deco Quilts, from choosing the right fabrics for an authentic look, to estimating yardage, cutting fabric and planning their piecing. Linn is an award-winning professional machine quilter, affectionately known in the business as Mr. Quilt for his magnificent heirloom machine quilting. Readers learn to mix and match simple shapes into bold, stylized quilts. They learn to design striking, stylized quilts inspired by 1930s Art Deco style. Simple geometric shapes mix and match into original, one-of-a-kind designs. Complete instructions for a sample quilt take readers step by step through planning, designing, and piecing their quilt. The book includes a photo gallery of 11 stunning quilts created by student quilters, plus a visual history of Art Deco style and architecture. Chapters of Design Art Deco Quilts include: 1. Art Deco Design Concepts 2. Tools, Supplies, and Fabric Selection. Many of which readers probably have on hand. 3. Design Steps. Explains the process. 4. Piecing Sequence Gallery. Breaks it down to make it easier. 5. Curved and Inset Seam Piecing. Lots of tips to take the anxiety out of it. 6. Quilting Ideas and Tips. Tips on choosing designs in relation to goals. 7. Design Components. Provides tools to spark readers imaginations in designing. Linn says he first became interested in art deco designs when he was working with fused glass while taking a break from quilting. The simple geometric designs readily lent themselves to cutting and fusing glass. It occurred to him that these simple geometric designs might lend themselves to some new and unusual quilt designs, and that inspired this book. Design Art Deco Quilts has a lovely gallery of Linns students art deco quilts. His design technique encourages readers to try something new and create their own works of art. (Sirreadalot.org, April 1, 2010)<br><br>A career in drafting has no doubt heavily influenced Don Linn's approach to designing quilts. This is very much a technique book, not a project book. It's likely to appeal to quiltmakers who enjoy the arithmetic and the technical challenges that arise from starting with graph paper and pencil, sketching a design, then working out how to piece it together. Don regularly uses curved and inset seams in his work, so these techniques are explained in detail. He also covers quilting ideas and includes a gallery of his students' art deco quilts and some geometric motifs in the art deco style to inspire you.

In the early 1990's, Anton began studying Talmud in a class for women taught by Rachel Adler, now a professor at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles.

Slowly but surely, she began to research the family and the time in which they lived.

As global economics become increasingly interconnected, Christian business people and entrepreneurs have unanticipated opportunities to build kingdom-strategic business ventures. But Christian companies and business leaders do not automatically accomplish missional purposes. BAM requires mastery of both the world of business and the world of missions, merging and contextualizing both into something significantly different than either alone. C. Neal Johnson offers the first comprehensive guide to business as mission for practitioners. He provides conceptual foundations for understanding BAM&#39;s unique place in global mission and prerequisites for engaging in it. Then he offers practical resources for how to do BAM, including strategic planning and step-by-step operational implementation. Drawing on a wide variety of BAM models, Johnson works through details of both mission and business realities, with an eye to such issues as management, sustainability and accountability. Business as mission is a movement with enormous potential. This book breaks new ground in how faith and work intersect and are lived out in crosscultural contexts, where job creation and community transformation go hand in hand. Come, participate in what may well be one of the most strategic mission paradigms of the 21st century.</p><p><strong>C. Neal Johnson</strong> (Ph.D., Fuller Theological Seminary) is founding dean of the School of Business and is professor of international business at Bakke Graduate University in Seattle, Washington.

(Tom A. Steffen, Missiology, October 2010)<br><br>"I see this book as exactly what it should be: a helpful and thorough resource based upon years of hard work and research, yet delivered in an accessible and readable way for the highly motivated and engaged BAM practitioner.... It is for those who are going to fully embrace the promise and challenge of operating a business with the goal of contributing to the <em>Missio Dei</em>. (Mark L. Russell, EMQ, July 2010)<br><br>"A helpful and thorough resource based upon years of hard work and research, delivered in an accessible and readable way." (Mark L. Russell, EMQ, July 2010)<br><br>"There is a growing awareness throughout the world church that in the twenty-first century business as mission (BAM) may well prove to one of God?s primary, if not the principle, instrument of world evangelization and kingdom transformation. Neal Johnson?s presentation of BAM is masterful, comprehensive, clear, wonderfully readable, motivating and challenging--the best in the field. May this work help to motivate and mobilize biblical Christians around the globe to new, creative and committed missionary action to, within and through the marketplace to proclaim in word and deed the coming of the kingdom of God in Jesus Christ, by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Charles Van Engen, Arthur F. Glasser Professor of Biblical Theology of Mission, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Finally, a complete book on the subject of business as mission. If <em>God Is at Work</em> is the 'why' of BAM, clearly, Neal's work is the 'how.' It is detailed, packed with great advice providing a step-by-step approach to doing BAM. It is punctuated with examples and tells it like it is. As the working encyclopedia for business as mission, it is a must for anyone who is considering work in this field directly or tangentially." (Ken Eldred, author, God Is at Work)<br><br>"Masterfully combining 'how come' and 'how to,' Neal Johnson has crafted an instant classic on marketplace missiology. His unusually rich experiences in work, ministry and education prepared him to offer in a single volume almost everything we need to know philosophically, theologically, scripturally and practically with the greatest mission opportunity in the twenty-first century--business as mission. While elaborating the complexities and ambiguities of definition and implementation--this is no slick quick fix book--Johnson leaves us with a heart panting after God?s own heart in the words of Jesus: 'As the Father has sent me, I am sending you' (John 20:21), a fully incarnational mission."

If you want simple bromides about business as a mission field, this book is not for you. But if you recognize the centrality of work in God's created order, and if you want to integrate Christian teachings and workplace life through the lens of mission, then this richly resourced book is a must-read."

One aspect of Nazism that has not received sufficient attention from historians of the Third Reich is the doctrine&#x2019;s origins in the Thule Society and its covert activities. A Munich occult group with a political agenda, the Thule Society was led by Rudolf von Sebottendorff, a German commoner who had been adopted by nobility during a sojourn in the Ottoman Empire. After returning to Europe, Sebottendorff embraced a form of theosophy that stressed the racial superiority of Aryans. The Thule Society attempted to establish an anti-Semitic, working-class front for disseminating its esoteric ideas and founded the German Workers&#x2019; Party, which Hitler would later transform into the National Socialist German Workers&#x2019; (Nazi) Party. Several of the society&#x2019;s members eventually assumed prestigious posts in the Third Reich. David Luhrssen has written the first comprehensive study of the society&#x2019;s activities, its cultural roots, and its postwar ramifications in a historical-critical context. Both general readers and academics concerned with European cultural and intellectual history will find that <i>Hammer of the Gods</i> opens new perspectives on nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe.</p><p>DAVID LUHRSSEN is the arts and entertainment editor at Milwaukee&#x2019;s Shepherd Express and has worked as a film critic for more than twenty years.

On the basis of field trips in the 1980s, Thomas has now updated her book to show what happened to the Bushmen as the tide of industrial civilization&#x2014;with its flotsam of property rights, wage labor, and alcohol&#x2014;swept over them. The result is a powerful, elegiac look at an endangered culture as well as a provocative critique of our own.<br><br>"The charm of this book is that the author can so truly convey the strangeness of the desert life in which we perceive human traits as familiar as our own. . . . <i>The Harmless People</i> is a model of exposition: the style very simple and precise, perfectly suited to the neat, even fastidious activities of a people who must make their world out of next to nothing."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>The Atlantic</i></p><p>On the basis of field trips in the 1980s, Thomas has now updated her book to show what happened to the Bushmen as the tide of industrial civilization-with its flotsam of property rights, wage labor, and alcohol-swept over them.Between 1950 and 1956 <b>Elizabeth Marshall Thomas</b> accompanied three expeditions to visit the Bushmen hunter-gatherers of Southwest Africa (now Namibia) and Bechuanaland (now Botswana). At that time the Bushmen were the last significant population who still lived by hunting and gathering, the economy practiced by all human beings and the ancestors of human beings for millions of years. Few firsthand accounts of hunter-gatherer life were written before her book&nbsp;<i>The Harmless People</i>, and because, since its publication, most Bushmen have been evicted from their old homes or forced to change their traditional ways, it remains one of only a few accounts of the old way of life. Thomas, who has spent the last 20 years studying animal behavior, makes her home in New Hampshire. Her other writing includes a nonfiction book about Dodoth pastoralists in northern Uganda,&nbsp;<i>Warrior Herdsmen</i>, and a novel about prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Northern Hemisphere,&nbsp;<i>Reindeer Moon</i>.</p><h2>Big World, Small Planet: Abundance within Planetary Boundaries</h2><p><b>A profoundly original vision of an attainable future that ensures human prosperity by safeguarding our threatened planet </b><br><br><b>"If you have time to read one book on this subject, I highly recommend the new </b><b><i>Big World, Small Planet</i></b><b>, by Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Center, and Mattias Klum, whose stunning photographs of ecosystem disruptions reinforce the urgency of the moment."&#x2014;Thomas L.

(Andrea Reece <i>LoveReading4Kids</i> 2017-06-01)<br><br>"(starred review) The story begins, "Once upon a time, there lived a jungle"--the word "lived" setting the tone for the book's theme of the jungle as a living thing, and this marvelous textual precision continues. The text is succinct, with only a few words per page, and the illustrations are clean and stylized with bright colors against a black background, but their sum total is a marvel of economy, clarity, and breadth. The beginning pages tell of the ants, who are preyed on by the mantis, who in turn is hunted by the lizard, and as the story continues, the illustrations pull farther back in scope, with repeating features, such as a butterfly, to anchor them. Attentive readers will find layers of creatures and plants within the illustrations, amplifying the idea of the layered life of the jungle. As the story concludes, the text loops back to its beginning, giving readers an understanding of the circularity of the food chain. The book ends with two gatefolds, both skillful<br> summations. One is an expansive three-page illustration of creatures that live in the jungle, and the other presents a clear, logical explanation of a food chain. The heart of an ecosystem has never been better presented for young readers." (<i>Kirkus</i> 2017-08-21)<br><br>A rainforest ecosystem is explored in this eye catching, informational picture book... The patterned, simply stated text uses many action words which propel the action forward, like "marched", "snacked", "crept", "pounced". The nuanced word choices are also witty and playful... James Boast's bright and bold illustrations are mesmerizing. The creatures seem to leap out against the jet black, velvety dark backgrounds. Different perspectives are afforded, including an underground view of worms and the partial skeleton of the panther. Brilliantly coloured flowers, insects, and birds fill the background details with movement and beauty. Once Upon a Jungle, a succinct and poetic picture book, is perfect for introducing many environmental topics.

Marty's vivid chronological account of the people and events that carved the spiritual landscape of America.

The narrative unfolds through sharply detailed biographical vignettes&#x2014;stories of religious "pathfinders," including William Penn, Mary Baker Eddy, Henry David Thoreau, and many other leaders of movements, both marginal and mainstream. In addition, Marty considers the impact of religion on social issues such as racism, feminism, and utopianism.<p>And engrossing, highly readable, and comprehensive history, <b>Pilgrims in Their Own Land</b> is written with respect, appreciation, and insight into the multitude of religious groups that represent expressions of spirituality in America.</p></p><p><b>Martin Marty</b>, one of today&#x2019;s most respected theologians, is professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, where the Martin Marty Center has been founded to promote public religion endeavors.

Offutt, who "draws landscape and constructs dialogue with the eyes and ears of a native son" <i>(The Miami Herald),</i> is on strong home turf here, capturing those who have left the Kentucky hills and long to return. These are stories of gravediggers and drifters, gamblers and truck drivers a long way from home, tales that are so full of hard edges they can't help but tell some hard truths.</p><p><i>Out of the Woods</i> starts with one man leaving his Kentucky hollow and ends with another who realizes he can't return. In between, Chris Offutt's broke, lonely, or just plain down-on-their-luck characters find out exactly how difficult it is to go home again, and how equally difficult it is to stop wishing they could. The critically acclaimed author of <i>The Good Brother</i> (a novel), as well as a memoir and a previous collection of stories, Offutt writes with rare honesty, insight, and restraint. "Sometimes I don't think I've done anything to leave my mark in this world. I'm the kind of person the world leaves a mark on," admits the narrator of "Two-Eleven All Around." The same might be said of all Offutt's Appalachian transplants, from the small-town sheriff of "Melungeons," forever marked by the violence and beauty of his mountain upbringing, to the rootless ex-con of "Moscow, Idaho," who wonders "if he'd ever find a woman, a job he liked, or a town he wanted to stay in." These lives are rendered in prose stripped so bare it reads like poetry--and yet is not without its own flinty wit. Given his first glimpse of his brother-in-law's corpse, the protagonist of the title story allows as how "he didn't look dead, but Gerald didn't think he looked too good either. He looked like a man with a bad hangover that he might shake by dinner." These are characters who get inside your head and stories worth reading again and again. As spare and simple as a Shaker chair, Offutt's tales should prove every bit as enduring. <i>--Mary Park</i><b>Chris Offutt</b> grew up in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Kentucky and has held more than fifty part-time jobs.

Things seem to be going from bad to worse until she meets cute next-door neighbor Zander and his 1970s Dodge Challenger. Emily has never felt as at home as she does working under the hood of a car. Can Zander help her find her faith again? VERDICT Clipston, the best-selling author of the &#x201c;Kauffman Amish Bakery&#x201d; series, makes her young adult fiction debut with glowing results. Emily&#x2019;s angst over losing her mother and being compared to her more feminine cousin is palpable. Engaging characters and abelievable story line make this a sure bet for teens who enjoy Melody Carlson. It will also appeal to adult readers of YA fiction. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>In her first novel for teens, adult author Clipston (the Kaufmann Amish Bakery series) presents the conventional spiritual journey of 17-year-old Emily, whose life has been uprooted since her mother's death from cancer: Emily's father's auto shop went belly up, they lost their house to foreclosure, and had to sell the beloved '69 Camaro she had fixed up. And moving in with her wealthy aunt, uncle, and beautiful cousin Whitney (to whom she has always been compared) makes Emily feel like a charity case. Emily rebuffs repeated invitations from Whitney and her friends, the pastoral staff at their new church, and her father, preferring to stay in her room writingjournal entries to her mother and pondering her uncertain relationship withGod. A developing friendship with Zander, a cute neighbor who shares her passion for cars, provides some solace, but she finds his strong Christian faith unnerving. Emily's struggles with grief, difference, dependency, and the need for someone to depend on provide opportunities for growth, friendship, and budding romance. The story follows a predictable course, but the characters are well developed and it remains affecting. Ages 13&#x2013;16.

In <i>Decomposed</i>, Kyle Devine offers another perspective. He shows that recorded music has always been a significant exploiter of both natural and human resources, and that its reliance on these resources is more problematic today than ever before. Devine uncovers the hidden history of recorded music&#x2015;what recordings are made of and what happens to them when they are disposed of. </p><p>Devine's story focuses on three forms of materiality. Before 1950, 78&nbsp;rpm records were made of shellac, a bug-based resin. Between 1950 and 2000, formats such as LPs, cassettes, and CDs were all made of petroleum-based plastic. Today, recordings exist as data-based audio files. Devine describes the people who harvest and process these materials, from women and children in the Global South to scientists and industrialists in the Global North. He reminds us that vinyl records are oil products, and that the so-called vinyl revival is part of petrocapitalism. The supposed immateriality of music as data is belied by the energy required to power the internet and the devices required to access music&nbsp;online. We tend to think of the recordings we buy as finished products. Devine offers an essential backstory. He reveals how a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;apparently peripheral people and processes are actually central to what music is, how it works, and why it matters.</p></p><p>Kyle Devine is Head of Research and Associate Professor in the Department of Musicology at the University of Oslo.<p>Did you know that the CO2&nbsp;equivalents generated by consumption of recorded music have not declined in the era of music streaming&#x2015;supposedly an era of music dematerialized, rendered virtual&#x2015;but instead have as much as doubled? Kyle Devine knows, and in&nbsp;<i>Decomposed&nbsp;</i>he teaches us about such things with intelligence, humaneness, and passion. His book is at once a history of materialities of recording, from lac beetle resins in the 1920s to today's energy-sump server farms, and a manifesto for ecological scrutiny of our musical behaviors.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gary Tomlinson</b>, John Hay Whitney Professor of Music and Humanities, Yale University; author of&nbsp;<i>A Million Years of Music</i><br><br><p>Kyle Devine brilliantly excavates the political ecologies of sound reproduction, moving from nineteenth-century chemical labs and shellac harvests to Thai vinyl record plants and the infrastructures of streaming media.&nbsp;<i>Decomposed</i>&nbsp;is a highly original and wonderfully compelling book&#x2015;a must-read for anyone interested in music or the materiality of media.</p>&#x2015;<b>Nicole Starosielski</b>, Associate Professor, NYU; author of&nbsp;<i>The Undersea Network</i><br><br><p>Kyle Devine opens us to oil wells, studio albums, digital accessories, and much else &#x2015;creative, horrible, and in between&#x2015;on which music reproduction depends.

After speaking with dozens of victims, perpetrators, and experts, and reviewing a myriad of court cases and studies, the author explains how religious child maltreatment happens. She then takes an in-depth look at the many forms of child maltreatment found in religious contexts, including biblically-prescribed corporal punishment and beliefs about the necessity of &#34;breaking the wills&#34; of children; scaring kids into faith and other types of emotional maltreatment such as spurning, isolating, and withholding love; pedophilic abuse by religious authorities and the failure of religious organizations to support the victims and punish the perpetrators; and religiously-motivated medical neglect in cases of serious health problems. In a concluding chapter, Heimlich raises questions about children&#39;s rights and proposes changes in societal attitudes and improved legislation to protect children from harm. While fully acknowledging that religion can be a source of great comfort, strength, and inspiration to many young people, Heimlich makes a compelling case that, regardless of one&#39;s religious or secular orientation, maltreatment of children under the cloak of religion can never be justified and should not be tolerated.</p><p><b>Janet Heimlich</b>, formerly a freelance reporter for National Public Radio and other national radio networks for ten years, is now an independent journalist.

This book will have a profound impact upon the consciences and actions of readers from a wide range of religious perspectives who surely will be convinced, after finishing this book, that children deserve to be free from all forms of physical violence in the guise of discipline and the other forms of physical and mental abuse explored in Heimlich's book." --<b>Philip Greven</b>, author of <i>Spare the Child: The Religious Roots of Punishment and the Psychological Impact of Physical Abuse</i><p>"<b>Insightful, provocative</b>, exposing, and well written, Janet Heimlich casts a bright light on the presence of child abuse in institutional religion, forcing it out of the dark corners of denial and into the arena of honesty and reality.

With courage, compassion, and adept use of interviews and research on a wide range of violations, Janet Heimlich <b>grapples with causes and constructive solutions</b>. This is a book that all of us, but especially religious believers among us, should read as a first step to providing children the love and security they deserve. In my own teaching and research, I've looked for a book that focuses explicitly on how religion becomes entangled in harming children and am glad to have a book to recommend." --<b>Bonnie J.

After rightly noting that religion is most often not harmful to children, Janet Heimlich details the unique ability of religion in its worst manifestations to inflict lasting pain, humiliation, and terror on the most vulnerable members of our society.

She has been a finalist for the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the PEN/Hemingway Award. Her latest novel,&nbsp;<i>City of Girls</i>, comes out in June, 2019.A fine first collection of 12 stories that are richly varied in setting and content, and enlivened by their author's flair for vigorous dialogue and concise summary statement. Gilbert's tales are ostensibly linked by the metaphor indicated by her book's title (and underscored by her use as epigraph of the opening lines of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales). It's true that all her characters seek respect or self-definition, and also that many of them are looking for love, of whatever kind is available, in all the wrong places with all the people likeliest to hurt or disappoint them. More-or-less conventional sexual situations are explored with economy and wit in the title story's account of a young cowboy's truculent relationship with a female ranch-hand, the Saroyan-like ``Tall Folks'' in which a woman saloon owner slakes her loneliness, as it were, by falling for her handsome young nephew, and the amusing ``Landing,'' about a rootless woman's fascination with a sexy paratrooper. Gilbert strikes deeper with several more ambitious stories, most notably the resonant ``Elk Talk,'' a skillful symbolic revelation of a woman's endangered idyllic life in the Wyoming mountains; ``The Many Things That Denny Brown Did Not Know (Age Fifteen)'' (Gilbert has a thing for unwieldy titles), a clever picturing of adolescent confusion, presented through an ingeniously handled omniscient narration; and ``The Famous Torn and Restored Lit Cigarette Trick,'' a nicely understated account of a successful Hungarian immigrant in Pittsburgh whose violent nature becomes the guiding principle in his life. Ranging further still, Gilbert offers (in ``At the Bronx Terminal Vegetable Market'') a hauntingly vivid portrait of a naive porter who tries to convince himself he can run for president of his mob-controlled union. The best kind of debut volume: a striking display of a versatile writer flexing her muscles and tackling a broad array of subjects and themes. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The son of a Chicago construction executive with strong ties to the Democratic machine, Ryan became a star after World War II on the strength of his menacing performance as an anti-Semitic murderer in the film noir Crossfire. Over the next quarter century he created a gallery of brooding, neurotic, and violent characters in such movies as Bad Day at Black Rock, Billy Budd, The Dirty Dozen, and The Wild Bunch. His riveting performances expose the darkest impulses of the American psyche during the Cold War.<br><br>At the same time, Ryan's marriage to a liberal Quaker and his own sense of conscience launched him into a tireless career of peace and civil rights activism that stood in direct contrast to his screen persona.

Ryan was a fearless liberal who embraced controversial causes during a time when most Hollywood stars remained apolitical. Even many film scholars are unaware of this aspect of Ryan's career.

You can&#x2019;t do better than that around here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe I can. I&#x2019;ve got connections.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You have?&#x201d; He gave me a quick look. I wasn&#x2019;t looking so good. I hadn&#x2019;t shaved or washed that day, and my clothes had been slept in.<br><br> He must have decided I was lying. He said with broad irony: &#x201c;Oh well, in that case,&#x201d; and stopped talking to me.<br><br> The highway had changed into the east end of the main street, half residential and half business. Neighborhood grocery stores, coal yards, gas stations, cheap taverns, big old rundown houses, a few churches with blank embarrassed faces. I couldn&#x2019;t remember the buildings ahead of time, but nearly everything was familiar once I saw it. I caught a whiff of the rubber factories on the south side, corrupting the spring night like an armpit odor. I watched the suppertime crowds on the street, looking for someone I might remember.<br><br> The driver applied the brakes, and the truck came to a stop at the curb.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you out here, bud. I can&#x2019;t take you down to the depot.&#x201d; He nodded toward the &#x201c;No Riders&#x201d; sticker on the windshield. &#x201c;But in case your connections don&#x2019;t pan out, you want to come down there. It&#x2019;s on Masters Street.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks. And thanks for the ride.&#x201d;<br><br> I hoisted my canvas suitcase from under my feet and climbed down out of the cabin. The big truck moved away and left me standing on the curb.<br><br> I walked a couple of blocks in the direction the truck had taken, but I was in no hurry to go anywhere. The excitement I had felt on coming back to the city had worn off already. Men and women passed me going both ways, but they were nobody I knew. A policeman gave me a sharp glance. I realized that I must look like a bum, and the realization made me feel like one. I began to wonder for the first time that day if my connections in the town were worth anything. Perhaps they didn&#x2019;t even exist any more.<br><br> I passed a new apartment building whose windows were like holes in a box of light. Through one of them I caught a glimpse of a man and woman dancing to the radio, holding each other close. It was enough to bring back the feeling of loneliness that I had been having off and on for years. I wanted to know every room in every apartment in that building I had never seen before, and call everyone who lived there by his first name. At the same time I wished I had the power to destroy the building and everybody in it.<br><br> I hadn&#x2019;t had a fight for a long time, and I was spoiling for one.<br><br> Across the street a neon sign said: &#x201c;Schlitz Beer on Draught,&#x201d; and I crossed to it. The plate-glass window of the tavern was half-curtained, but I could see over the curtain. It was a big square room full of wooden chairs and tables, with a bar at the back. In the cold yellow light of the fly-specked ceiling lamps, I could see that the tables were scarred by carved initials and the charred grooves left by untended cigarettes. The place was almost empty, and the few people that were there didn&#x2019;t look as if they&#x2019;d make me feel out of place.<br><br> I went inside and sat on a stool at the bar. The bartender paid no attention to me. He was busy being a character for the benefit of a couple of other customers, a peroxide blonde and a henna redhead at the other end of the bar. The girls were sitting one on each side of a big young man in a topcoat made of imitation llama.<br><br> &#x201c;So you want another drink,&#x201d; the bartender said with a wide cruel smile. &#x201c;You think I got nothing better to do than give you another drink. Don&#x2019;t you know by this time of night all I can think about is my feet? My feet are killing me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that a promise?&#x201d; the peroxide blonde said in a shrill, peroxide-blonde voice. The women giggled, and the man between them hugged them, one under each arm.<br><br> &#x201c;The way you talk,&#x201d; the bartender said, &#x201c;the way you talk, you&#x2019;d think I get paid money to stand here and feed you characters whisky&#x2014;when all the time my feet are killing me.&#x201d;<br><br> He was gray-headed and massive. His belly hung out over his belt and swayed like a huge bosom when he moved.<br><br> &#x201c;You should try reducing, Henry,&#x201d; the blonde said. &#x201c;Take some of that weight off your feet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, okay,&#x201d; the bartender said. &#x201c;You asked for it and you&#x2019;ll get it. But I warn you this bar whisky is the lousiest stuff this side of the sewer farm.&#x201d; He poured three shots out of an unlabeled bottle and set them on the bar.<br><br> &#x201c;You should know, Henry,&#x201d; the blonde said.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s milk to me,&#x201d; Henry said.<br><br> I rapped on the bar with a quarter.<br><br> &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s getting impatient,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;When somebody gets impatient that makes me nervous. When I get nervous I&#x2019;m no damn good for anything at all.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A bottle of beer,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;Look at my hand,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s trembling like a leaf.&#x201d; He held out a big gray hand and smiled down at it. &#x201c;Beer, you say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If this place is still in business.&#x201d;<br><br> He took a bottle out of the cooler, uncapped it, and shuffled along the bar towards me.<br> He looked at me with potential dislike. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, you got no sense of humor?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure, but I checked it in another town. Go right on being sidesplitting for your friends.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a stranger in town, aren&#x2019;t you? Maybe you just don&#x2019;t know how we talk around here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m learning fast.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t learn too fast.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you serve glasses with your beer? I&#x2019;ll have one.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Olive or maraschino?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Just dip your thumb in it when you pour it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pour it yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> I picked up my bottle and glass and sat down at a table against the wall. An old man with a glass of beer in front of him was facing me at the next table. There was a shag of beard on his face, shading from pure white on his cheeks and upper lip to iron gray on his flabby neck. When I had poured my beer and raised my glass to my lips, he raised his glass and winked at me.<br><br> I smiled back before I drank, and regretted it a minute later when he got up and moved towards my table. A shapeless brown overcoat hung about his body, and he walked like a sack of rags. He slumped into the other chair, rested his moth-eaten arms on the table, and leaned towards me with a sweet, dirty smile, which showed no teeth. He smelled of beer and age.<br><br> &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t used to be like this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But after all, life begins at sixty-five.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you sixty-five?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;�Sixty-six. Yeah, I know I look older, but those strokes I had take it out of a man. The first one gave me a hell of a jolt, but it didn&#x2019;t hurt me any except that it slowed me down. But the second one was a dandy. I still can&#x2019;t use my left hand, probably never will be able to again.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got funny reasons for saying that life begins at sixty-five.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sweet C�sar, those aren&#x2019;t my reasons! It&#x2019;s for different reasons entirely that my life began at sixty-five. That was when I qualified.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Qualified for what? Voting?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Qualified for the old-age pension, son. Ever since then I&#x2019;ve been my own boss. No more getting pushed around, no more licking asses, not for me! Nobody can take that pension away from me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a great thing,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a wonderful thing. It&#x2019;s the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me in my life.&#x201d;<br><br> He finished his beer and I ordered him another.<br><br> &#x201c;Who was your boss before you got the pension?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can you imagine what they did to me?&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;And that was when I couldn&#x2019;t walk yet after my second stroke. They put me out in the county poorhouse, with nobody to look after me except my chums out there. They said all the hospitals were full. I still have some of the bedsores I got then. And then they weren&#x2019;t going to give me my old-age pension, even after I qualified.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What was the matter?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You see, son, I couldn&#x2019;t prove my age. You&#x2019;d think if they took one look at me they could see how old I am, but that wasn&#x2019;t good enough. I was born on a farm and my daddy never registered my birth, so I couldn&#x2019;t get a birth certificate. I would&#x2019;ve been up the creek without a paddle, if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Mr. Allister. He got my case investigated and people to swear to me, and everything turned out jake. Now I got me a little place of my own under the stairs at the warehouse, and nobody can say boo to me.&#x201d;<br><br> Two men came in and sat down at a table near us. One was short and broad. He wore a limp cloth cap and a decayed leather windbreaker. The other was tall and very thin, his face a vague triangle with the apex pointed down. He took a mouth organ out of the pocket of his shiny blue suit coat and blew a few dreamy notes. His companion drummed on the table with cracked dirty knuckles and looked stonily ahead.<br><br> &#x201c;Who is this Allister?&#x201d; I asked the old man.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know who Mr. Allister is? You haven&#x2019;t been around here long, have you? Mr. Allister is the Mayor of this town.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And he helped you with your pension? He must be a pretty good egg.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mr. Allister is the finest man in this town.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Things have changed around here,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It used to be that J.D. Weather was the man to go to when you needed help like that. He used to have a line-up at his office every morning.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;J.D. Weather got killed before I had my second stroke. Let me see, that was two years ago this coming June. You used to live in this town, eh?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;J.D. Weather got killed?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, about two years ago. Excuse me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait a minute. How did he get killed?&#x201d; I put my hand on his arm, which felt like a bone wrapped in rags.<br><br> &#x201c;He just plain got killed,&#x201d; the old man said impatiently. &#x201c;Somebody shot him and he died.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake! Who shot him?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You got to let me go, son. I been drinking beer.&#x201d;<br><br> I let go of his arm and he shuffled away to the men&#x2019;s room. The blonde and the redhead and their joint property in imitation llama had drifted away to other bars. The short man and the tall man finished their draught beers and wandered into the men&#x2019;s room. Now the room was deserted except for the bartender, who was wiping glasses and paying no attention to me. The ugly, empty room was one of a long series of lonely bars in towns I didn&#x2019;t know. If J.D. Weather was dead, this town was going to be as lonely as the rest.<br><br> There was a low growl of men&#x2019;s voices from the lavatory. I couldn&#x2019;t make out any words but there was unpleasantness in the sound, which was emphasized a minute later by a muffled thud. I glanced at the bartender, but he was busy with his glasses.<br><br> Then somebody sobbed in the men&#x2019;s room. I got up and walked through the door. The old man was sitting on the dirty tile floor with his back to the wall. A bead of blood had fallen from one of his nostrils onto his white mustache. The tall mouth organist and his companion stood in the center of the small room, watching me. The old man&#x2019;s hat was on the floor near their feet.<br><br>The old man was crying. &#x201c;They took my money,&#x201d; he sobbed. &#x201c;Make them give me back my money.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t got his money,&#x201d; the short man said. &#x201c;He called me a dirty name, so I gave him a slap.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The lousy, bullying bastards!&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;They took my sixteen dollars.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You shut up,&#x201d; said the tall man, taking a step towards him.<br><br> &#x201c;Leave him alone,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And give him back his money.&#x201d;<br><br> The tall man stayed where he was.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yeah?&#x201d; the short man said. His eyes were bright blue, as hard and glistening as glass eyes. &#x201c;You and who else is going to make me?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting tired waiting,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Give him back his money.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have no money,&#x201d; the short man said. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Swainie, let&#x2019;s get the hell out of here.&#x201d;<br><br> I braced my heel on the doorjamb and swung as I moved into him. He ducked his jaw quickly, but my fist caught the bridge of his nose. He moved in on me and clinched me around the waist with his round head under my right arm.</p><h2>Math rules!: 5th-6th grade 25 week enrichment challenge *Now includes PDF of Book*</h2><p>25 week enrichment challenge for gifted or regular students offers math enrichment activities to develop logic and reasoning skills while building self-confidence and understanding of mathematics.

Now that reputation, and a stroke of good timing, lands Sorrel an unexpected opportunity: reviving a long-dormant Shakespearean garden on an English country estate. </p><p>Arriving at Kirkwood Hall, ancestral home of Sir Graham Kirkwood and his wife Stella, Sorrel is shocked by the desolate state of the walled garden. Generations have tried&#x2014;and failed&#x2014;to bring it back to glory. Sorrel senses heartbreak and betrayal here, perhaps even enchantment.

It is the answer he gave his wife (now ex-wife) years earlier when she told him that she wanted one. The loss, longing and regret that haunt the years between those two &#x201c;no&#x201d;s give rise to one of the most eloquent meditations ever written on the Holocaust. <br><br>As Kertesz&#x2019;s narrator addresses the child he couldn&#x2019;t bear to bring into the world he ushers readers into the labyrinth of his consciousness, dramatizing the paradoxes attendant on surviving the catastrophe of Auschwitz. <b>Kaddish for the Unborn Child</b> is a work of staggering power, lit by flashes of perverse wit and fueled by the energy of its wholly original voice. <br>Translated by Tim Wilkinson</p><p>Imre Kertesz was born in 1929 in Budapest. As a youth, he was imprisoned in Auschwitz and later in Buchenwald. He worked as a journalist and playwright before publishing Fateless, his first novel, in 1975. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2002.No!" I said instantly and at once, without hesitating and, virtually, instinctively since it has become quite natural by now that our instincts should act contrary to our instincts, that our counterinstincts, so to say, should act instead of, indeed as, our instincts--I'm joking, if this can be regarded as a joking matter; that is, if one can regard the naked, miserable truth as a joking matter, is what I tell the philosopher approaching me, now that both he and I have come to a halt in the beech wood, beech coppice, or whatever they are called, stunted and almost audibly wheezing from disease, perhaps from consumption; I must confess to being a dunce about trees, I can recognize only pine trees instantly, on account of their needles--oh yes, and plane trees as well, because I like them, and even nowadays, even by my counterinstincts, I still recognize what I like intuitively, even if not with that same chest-thumping, gut-wrenching, knee-jerking, galvanizing, inspired, so to say, flash of recognition as when I recognize things I detest. "I don't know why it is that every time everything is different in every respect with me, or perhaps if I do know, it's simpler that I know without knowing it. That would spare me a lot of explanations. But, it would seem, there is no getting around explanations, we are constantly explaining and excusing ourselves; life itself, that inexplicable complex of being and feeling, demands explanations of us, those around us demand explanations, and in the end we ourselves demand explanations of ourselves, until in the end we succeed in annihilating everything around us, ourselves included, or in other words explain ourselves to death," I explain to the philosopher with that compulsion to speak, to me so abhorrent and yet irrepressible, that always grips me when I have nothing to say for myself--and that, I fear, has roots in common with the stiff tips that I hand out in brasseries and taxis, or bribing, etc. official or semiofficial personages, along with my exaggerated politeness, a politeness exaggerated to the point of self-denial, as if I were continually apologizing for my existence, for this existence. For heaven's sake! I had simply set off for a walk in the woods (even if it is only this meager oak wood) in the fresh air (even if the air is somewhat putrid) to blow the cobwebs away (let us put it that way since it sounds good, as long as we don't look too closely at the meanings of words, because if we do look, then the words have no meaning at all, do they? since I don't have any cobwebs that need blowing away, quite the contrary, I am exquisitely sensitive to drafts); I am (was) spending my time here, fleetingly (and I will not digress here on the digressions that this word offers), in the lap of this mediocre mid-Hungarian hill range, in a creative writers' retreat--one might call it a holiday home, though it also does for a workplace (for I am always working, being driven to this not just by the need to make a living, but because if I were not working <i>I would be existing</i>, and if I were existing I don't know what that would drive me to, and it is better not to know, although my bones, my guts have their hunches, to be sure, since the reason I work incessantly is that as long as I keep working, I am, whereas if I didn't work, who knows whether I would be or not; so I take it seriously, and I have to take it seriously because a deadly serious association is sustained between my sustenance and my work, that is perfectly obvious); so anyway, in a house where I had gained the right of admittance into the illustrious society of intellectuals of my ilk, whose paths for that very reason I can in no way avoid crossing, for all my soundless lying low in my room--the secret of my hiding place betrayed at most by the muted tapping of my typewriter--and for all my scurrying about on tiptoe in the corridors, one has to have meals, yet then table companions surround me with their relentless presence, and one has to take strolls, yet, smack in the middle of the woods, who should I find coming the other way, in his very own stocky and incongruous self, in his brown-and-beige-checked cap and his loose-fitting raglan overcoat, with the narrow slits of his whey-colored eyes and his big, soft, kneaded and already risen dough face, but Dr. Obl�th, the philosopher. That is his regular civilian occupation, as attested, incidentally, by the relevant entry in his identity card--to wit, that Dr. Obl�th is a philosopher just like Immanuel Kant or Baruch Spinoza or Heraclitus of Ephesus, just as I myself am a writer and literary translator, and the only reason I do not paint myself in an even more ridiculous light compared with the giants who can be marshaled behind the banner of my craft, giants who were genuine writers and, in some cases, genuine literary translators, is because I look ridiculous enough as it is having this as my profession and because my activities as a literary translator nevertheless invest my efforts at keeping myself occupied with some semblance of objectivity and, possibly, in some people's eyes--above all, in the eyes of the authorities and, albeit for different reasons, of course, in my own eyes too--of a verifiable profession. <br><br>"No!" something had bellowed and howled inside me, instantly and at once, when my wife (though as it happens long since not my wife) first made mention of it--of you--and my whimpering abated only gradually, yes, actually only after the passage of many long years, into a gloomy weltschmerz, like Wotan's raging fury during the renowned farewell scene, until a question assumed ever more definite form within me, emerging as it were from the mist-shrouded figurations of stifled string voices, slowly and malignantly, like an insidious illness, and you are that question; or to be more precise, I am, but an I rendered questionable by you; or to be even more precise (and Dr. Obl�th, too, broadly agrees with this): <i>my existence viewed as the potentiality of your being</i>, or in other words, me as a murderer, if one wishes to take precision to the extreme, to the point of absurdity, and albeit at the cost of a certain amount of self-torment, since, thank God, it's too late now, now it'll always be too late; that is permissible too, you are not, whereas I can be assured of being in complete safety, having ruined everything, smashed everything to bits, with that "no," above all my ill-starred, short-lived marriage, I tell (told) Dr. Obl�th, doctor of philosophy, with a dispassion that life may never have been able to inculcate in me but which I have nevertheless by now become quite practiced at practicing should it be absolutely necessary. And it was necessary on this occasion because the philosopher was approaching me in contemplative mood, as I immediately discerned from the slight sideways tilt of his head, on which was flatly perched his rakish peaked-cap, as if he were an oncoming comic highwayman who had already knocked back a few glasses and was now deliberating whether to rap me on the head or make do with some ransom money. But of course (and I was about to say: sadly) Obl�th was not deliberating that at all; philosophers do not commonly deliberate about highwaymanship, or if they do happen to, then it manifests itself to them in the form of a weighty philosophical question, and they leave the dirty work to the professionals, for, after all, one has seen that sort of thing before, though it was sheer whimsy and all but an aspersion for me to allow such an association with Dr. Obl�th, of all people, to cross my mind, for I know nothing about his past, nor will he recount it, it is to be hoped. No, but he did surprise me with a no less indiscreet question, rather as if a highwayman were to inquire how much money I have in my pocket, for he began to pry into my family circumstances, though, to be fair, only after having first led up to that by informing me about his own, as a down payment, so to say, on the premise, so to say, that if I were allowed to find out everything about him, despite my being not in the slightest bit interested, he would thereby earn the right to my . . . but I shall break off this exegesis as I sense that the letters and words are carrying me away, and carrying me away in the wrong direction at that, in the direction of a moralizing paranoia, a state in which, sadly, I catch myself all too often these days and the reasons for which are all too obvious to me (loneliness, isolation, voluntary exile), not that those reasons worry me since they are of my own making, after all--so to say, the first few scoops of the spade towards the much, much deeper trench that I still have to dig out, clod by clod, from one end to the other, for there to be something to swallow me up (though maybe I am not digging in the ground but rather in the air because there one is unconfined)--since all Dr. Obl�th did was ask an innocent question as to whether I had a child; though certainly, with a philosopher's rude candor, which is to say tactlessly and in any case at the worst possible moment, but then, how was he to have known that his question would, undeniably, somewhat upset me. Or that I would then reply to the question with an overwhelming compulsion to speak that sprang from my exaggerated sense of politeness, a politeness exaggerated to the point of self-denial, repellent to me from first to last even as I was speaking, despite which I nevertheless recounted that: <br><br>"No!" I had said instantly and at once, without hesitation and, so to say, instinctively since it has become quite natural by now that our instincts act contrary to our instincts, that our counterinstincts, so to say, act instead of, indeed as, our instincts; yes, I was seeking to get back at Dr. Obl�th--Dr. Obl�th, doctor of philosophy, that is to say for all that idiotic blather, for my own voluntary and in no way justifiable (though I had plenty of justifications for it, a few of which I have already spelled out above, to the best of my recall) degradation in portraying him there, slap-bang in the middle of the emaciated beech wood (or linden grove, for all it matters), the way that I portrayed him, though the peaked-cap, the loose-fitting raglan overcoat, as well as the whey-colored eyes and the big, soft face like lumps of kneaded and risen dough, I still maintain, do indeed, accord fully with reality. It is just that it could all have been described otherwise, in a more balanced fashion, more considerately, perhaps even--and this is saying something--<i>with affection</i>; but, I fear, the only way I can describe anything now is with a pen dipped in sarcasm, derisively, perhaps even a touch humorously (it's not my place to judge that), yet also in certain respects lamely, as if someone were constantly jerking back my pen when it is poised to set down certain words, so that in the end my hand writes other words in their stead, words that will simply never round out into an affectionate portrait, perhaps simply<i> because, I fear, there is no affection</i> in me, but then--for heaven's sake!--for whom might I feel affection; and why? Yet Dr. Obl�th spoke endearingly enough, at least enough for me to record in final (I almost said fatal) form several of his more piquant observations, since they aroused my attention. The fact that he was childless, he said, that he had no one apart from an aging wife who was struggling with the problems of aging, if I understood him right, since the philosopher formulated it more opaquely or, one could also say, more discreetly than that, trusting me to understand what I wish to understand, and even though I did not have wish to, I did of course understand all the same. That this matter of his childlessness, Dr. Obl�th continued, had actually struck him only recently, but then very often, indeed this was precisely what he had been pondering just now on the woodland path and, lo and behold, he could not forbear to speak about it, presumably because he too was aging and, as a result, certain possibilities--for instance, the possibility of still having a child--were slowly no longer possible for him, indeed were impossible, and that in fact he had only begun to think much about this quite recently, and more specifically, he said, thinking of it "as a missed opportunity." At this point Dr. Obl�th halted on the path, for in the meantime we had set off again, two social beings, two men conversing on the forest litter, two sad blots on a landscape painter's canvas, two blots which in their essences shattered a natural harmony that has probably never existed, only I don't remember whether it was I who joined step with Obl�th to accompany him or he who joined step with me, but then one is not going to make this a matter of prestige: yes, naturally it was I who joined step with Obl�th, most probably in order to shake him off because that way I would be able to turn back at a later point of my own choosing; so anyway, at this point Dr. Obl�th came to a halt on the pathway and with a single melancholy gesture stiffened his doughy or even, here and there, puffily exuberant countenance, for he threw back his head, together with its impertinent, rakish cap, to fix his gaze on a tree branch opposite as if on a pitiful, ragged yet, even in its cast-offness, still serviceable item of clothing. And while we stood there in this way, mutely, I in Obl�th's and Obl�th in the tree's axis of attraction, I was assailed by the feeling that I was about to become party to a presumably confidential utterance by the philosopher; and that is indeed what happened when Dr. Obl�th finally spoke, and he said that in saying that he felt what had happened--or rather what had not happened--was a missed opportunity he was not thinking of continuity, that somewhat abstract and yet, let's be honest, basically satisfying solace of knowing he had fulfilled--or rather, and that was precisely the point, not fulfilled--his personal and suprapersonal business on this earth, that is, the business, over and above sustaining his existence, of the prolonged and propagated perpetuation and survival of that existence, and thereby of himself, in descendants, which (beyond sustaining one's existence) is, one might say, man's transcendental albeit highly practical duty in life, so as not to feel incomplete, superfluous and, ultimately, impotent; nor was he even thinking of the impending prospect of an old age without support, no, but in truth he feared something else: "emotional sclerosis," as he put it, those were his exact words, meanwhile setting off again along the path, ostensibly heading towards our base, the holiday home, but in reality, as I now knew, towards emotional sclerosis.</p><h2>Viscount Breckenridge to the Rescue: A Cynster Novel (Cynster Sisters Trilogy, 1)</h2><p>The Cynsters are back in a brilliant new series from <em>USA Today</em> and <em>New York Times</em> bestseller Stephanie Laurens!

Hatterr is the son of a European merchant officer and a lady from Penang who has been raised and educated in missionary schools in Calcutta. His story is of his search for enlightenment as, in the course of visiting seven Oriental cities, he consults with seven sages, each of whom specializes in a different aspect of &#x201c;Living.&#x201d; Each teacher delivers himself of a great &#x201c;Generality,&#x201d; each great Generality launches a new great &#x201c;Adventure,&#x201d; from each of which Hatter escapes not so much greatly edified as by the skin of his teeth. The book is a comic extravaganza, but as Anthony Burgess writes in his introduction, &#x201c;it is the language that makes the book. . . .

Offering a variety of "food plans," along with a set of techniques aimed at controlling emotional eating and cravings for "bad" foods, Dr. Joseph Mercola clearly understands how to motivate us--in one section, he suggests that rather than "living by the scale," we measure our success in relation to the fit of our favorite pair of slightly-too-snug jeans. Many recipes are included, most of which are free of the boring flavor substitutes so common in diet books. <p></p> The diet itself combines several familiar concepts. The "no grain" model emphasizes organic vegetables and quality protein, with limited fruits and absolutely no simple carbs. Mercola's idea of "quality protein" is somewhat startling--he is deeply concerned about toxins, and urges grass-fed beef over potentially mercury-filled fish. His main point is frequently reinforced: refined grains of any type are basically deadly and eating them should be viewed as an unhealthy addiction. <p></p> Here, the book veers off in a new direction: rather than gently nudging our habits in a new direction, he suggests we break what he insists is an addictive cycle with a method called "EFT," or "Emotional Freedom Technique." As a way to avoid surrendering to desires, his system of tapping acupressure points and repeating affirmations is used to overcome them. While repeat dieters will understand the necessity of examining emotional ties to food, Mercola's voice becomes a tad strident, and possibly downright offensive to those with a different opinion on what constitutes an addiction. <i>--Jill Lightner</i><p>DR.

Head smashed in by a baseball bat, genitals cut off by a dull knife. Forcade was once responsible for the confiscation of art works from the bourgeoisie fleeing the revolution. Had he really returned from exile just to visit his ailing father?</p><p>The novel evokes the disillusion of a generation, many of them veterans of the war in Angola, discovering the corruption of those who preceded them.

International fame came with the publication of the Havana Quartet, all featuring Lieutenant Mario Conde, of which Havana Black is the second to be available in English.The Quartet has been translated into seven languages and has won numerous prizes including Spain's Hammett Prize. Critically acclaimed translator known for extensive work on Juan Goytisolo.

This prize is said to be the Spanish Nobel Prize. Previous winners include Philip Roth, John Banville, Margaret Atwood, Amin Maalouf and Ismail Kadare. Padura is most famous for his Inspector Mario Conde novels, all published in English by Bitter Lemon Press.<br><br>In the third Mario "the Count" Conde mystery to appear in English (after <i>Adios, Hemingway</i> and <i>Havana Red</i>, both 2005), Miguel Forcade is found washed ashore, having been dispatched with a baseball bat and emasculated with a dull kitchen knife. Coaxed from intended retirement to uncover what might have tempted the presumably corrupt diplomat and defector to return to his native Cuba, Inspector Conde finds no shortage of Maltese falcons hidden away amidst seedy squalor during the revolution. Padura's world is both as unknowable as lost love and as simple as a stray dog, and his prose is given to lush and loquacious ruminations rife with doom and duende somewhat reminiscent of Paco Ignacio Taibo's more contemplative side. While perhaps not as accessible as L. A. Garcia-Roza or Arnaldo Correa, this series is drenched with that beguiling otherness so appealing to the many fans of mysteries from other cultures, and may also please those who appreciate the sultry lyricism of James Lee Burke.

A college-educated player from Pennsylvania farm country, he restored respectability to a game tarnished by the rowdies who had dominated baseball in the 1890s. <p><i>Pitching&nbsp;in a Pinch</i>, originally published in 1912, is an insider&#x2019;s account blending anecdote, biography, instruction, and social history. It celebrates baseball as it was played in the first decade of the twentieth century by famous contemporaries like Honus Wagner and Rube Marquand, managers like John McGraw and Connie Mack, and many others. Always sensitive to psychology as well as technique, Mathewson describes the &#x201c;dangerous batters&#x201d; he faced, the &#x201c;peculiarities&#x201d; of big-league pitchers, the &#x201c;good and bad&#x201d; of coaching, umpiring, sign-stealing, base-running, spring training, and the importance of superstition to athletes. Matty, as he was called, makes the reader feel that tense moment when a player in a pinch must use his head.</p></p><p>One of baseball's more enduring classics and earliest memoirs, Christy Mathewson's primer, first published in 1912, has also become one of the game's foremost anthropologies. Mathewson was one of baseball's first immortals: he was a star on the field, winning 373 games between 1900 and 1916--all but one as a Giant; an educated gentleman off the field; and a legitimate war hero who died from the effects of being gassed in World War I. <i>Pitching in a Pinch</i> passes on Mathewson's substantial knowledge of the game in general, and the intricacies of the mound in particular. The book's continuing delight and value rests in Mathewson's facility for capturing--from the inside--the game's ethos in the early 20th century, and the generous combination of anecdote and insight with which he shares it.Introducing this Bison Books edition is Eric Rolfe Greenberg, whose acclaimed novel The Celebrant (1993), also a Bison Book, portrays the immortal Christy Mathewson.</p><h2>Hasty Death: An Edwardian Murder Mystery (Edwardian Murder Mysteries, 2)</h2><p><p>Eager to join the working classes, Lady Rose Summer has abandoned the comforts of her parents' home to become self-supporting. But life as a working woman isn't quite what Rose had imagined---long hours as a typist and nights spent in a dreary women's hostel are not very empowering when you're poor, cold, and tired. Luckily for Rose, her drudgery comes to a merciful end when she learns of the untimely death of an acquaintance.</p><p>Freddy Pomfret, a silly and vacuous young man, was almost certainly up to no good before he was shot dead in his London flat. When Rose discovers incriminating evidence pointing to several members of her class, she returns to London high society in order to investigate properly. With the help of Captain Harry Cathcart and Superintendent Kerridge of Scotland Yard, Rose prepares to do the social rounds&#x2015;uncovering a devious blackmail plot and an unexpected killer.</p><p>Set in Britain during the Edwardian world of parties, servants, and scandal, M. C. Beaton's <i>Hasty Death </i>is a delightful combination of murderous intrigue and high society.</p></p><p>SECRETS TO DIE FOR<br>Lady Rose Summer refuses to abide by her parents' insistence that she marry. Even more distressing, she wants to become self-supporting by moving out with her maid Daisy and going to work in trade. On advice from Captain Harry Cathcart-a noble-born private investigator who knows the independent-minded Rose all too well-the Earl and Countess of Hadshire agree to let Rose work as a typist and live in a women's hostel. It isn't long before Rose realizes that life as a working woman isn't quite what she imagined...or before she inadvertently discovers that recently-murdered playboy Freddy Pomfret was a blackmailer. In order to investigate properly, Rose must now return to London high society's glittering, treacherous rounds. And from elegant London townhouses that conceal ugly secrets to a tranquil country estate where danger lurks along every path, she and Harry will follow a trail of deception, rumors, and devious plots-even as a singularly calculating killer prepares to end the rebellious Lady Rose's sleuthing for good.<br><br>"Fans of the author's Hamish Macbeth and Agatha Raisin mysteries, written under the name M.C. Beaton, will welcome this new series of historical whodunits."<br><i>-Booklist</i><br>M. C.

Compelling as the story is, this is hardly a conventional memoir. Rather, it interweaves biographical anecdote and family history with speculations on the historical development of early 20th-century Vienna as it was experienced by her parents' generation, and how the loss of their "high" culture affected the lives of these cultivated refugees in a democratic United States that was, and remains, deeply suspicious of perceived "elitism." This is, in other words, an intellectual memoir, both elegant and heartfelt, by one of America's leading critics, a narrative in which literary and philosophical reference is as central as the personal.</p><p>Marjorie Perloff is the Sadie Dernham Patek Professor of the Humanities Emerita at Stanford University and the author and editor of over a dozen books on literary and art criticism as well as cultural history.Since emigrating from Vienna with her family in 1938 at the age of six-and-a-half, the former Gabriele Mintz has made a reputation for herself under the penname Marjorie Perloff. Her books (The Dance of the Intellect; The Futurist Moment, etc.) have established her as one of the major American critics of 20th century modernist and late-modernist writing. In this memoir, she traces her intellectual and social development, showing how they were shaped by her experience as a refugee from a hostile territory that she would not see again until 1955, after she was married but still before she launched her career. Though Perloff works in resonances from Vienna&#x2019;s modernist artists throughout her book, most of it remains a straightforward telling of who her family was and is, and of how she navigated her way from the New York City schools to Oberlin College. Not a conventional coming-of-age memoir that processes things emotionally, Perloff&#x2019;s story of her youth hones in on the institutions, people and places that formed her logos, by chance and by choice. In that, it is entirely successful.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But now that the townspeople have chopped down all their trees, every year they have floods and droughts. Worse yet, there's a giant boulder blocking up the site of their new dam! Something has to be done. <br> Well, the young boy who helped make Abiyoyo disappear way back when now has a little girl of his own. And she knows the only way to save the town: Bring back Abiyoyo to help move the boulder. "Bring back Abiyoyo?" the townspeople cry. "The giant that eats people up?" But the little girl has a plan for that, too.... <br> Fifteen years after Pete Seeger's storysong "Abiyoyo" came to life as a picture book, his beloved giant is back in a wonderful new story. With Michael Hays's brilliant illustrations and a sing-along score included, <i>Abiyoyo Returns</i> is destined to become a family favorite.</p><p>Pete Seeger is a national treasure, arguably the most influential figure in American folk music as well as an important advocate of social causes.

This time, the townspeople are cutting down all the trees to build houses, and flooding results when the rains come. When they try to build a dam and run into a boulder nobody can move, the granddaughter of the magician responsible for Abiyoyo's previous disappearance convinces him to magic the big guy back. When the giant reappears in all his slobbery, stinking wonder, roaring for food, the townspeople rush to feed him. The little girl, in a ploy to get him to move the boulder, asks him if he is strong enough to do it, and he hurls it several hundred feet away. The villagers rejoice and everyone sings the now-famous song, faster and faster until, exhausted, the giant falls asleep. But they soon discover that Abiyoyo's feat has crushed the magic wand that would zap him away again, and the local folks must find a way to coexist peacefully with him. Seeger teaches several lessons in this clever if somewhat forced tale: the value of the environment, of sharing, and of the need to live with whatever "giants" are in one's life. Hays's colorful illustrations are just as wonderful as in the original tale, with the jagged-edged, overpowering monster oozing attitude from every pore. For those who felt it unfair of the town to zap away what they feared in the original book, this second installment will be a just and happy ending.<p></p><p><i>Jane Marino, Scarsdale Public Library, NY</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Midnight Marked (Chicagoland Vampires)</h2><p><b>As the Chicagoland Vampires series continues, Merit and Ethan find themselves in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, where winning may require the ultimate sacrifice...</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>A vampire&#x2019;s grudges don&#x2019;t stay dead long...</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Merit is one of Chicago's most skilled vampire warriors; these days, she doesn't scare easily.

Merit is en route to a Cubs game with her significant other, master vampire Ethan Sullivan, and their friends when they make an alarming discovery: the body of a shape-shifter who&#39;s clearly been murdered by a vampire, near a construct of mysterious alchemy symbols. Merit engages in alliances of varying success among Cadogan House, the other vampire houses, and the local shape-shifter packs and magic-wielders, trying to figure out whodunit, as another conflict develops from the machinations of the local criminal mastermind and his supernatural empire, the Circle. Series fans will be delighted by developments in Ethan and Merit&#39;s romance and impressed by Neill&#39;s willingness to take some narrative risks. Agent: Lucienne Diver, Knight Agency.

But it was Jason who was shaping the future of Jerusalem and with it, all Judea. He breathed in again, imagining that he could feel the wave of destiny impelling him forward toward his vision as he exhaled . . .</i><br><br> The Greeks have taken over the world, but Jerusalem is still the same backwater city Jason has always known. He wants to help his hometown rise to a new age of prosperity and influence. If that means stretching the terms of the city&#x2019;s divine covenant, so be it. But how far is he willing to go to achieve Greek greatness for this Jewish city? It will take the willingness of a handful of Jews to die rather than violate the covenant in order to turn the tide back to God.<br><br> Written by an internationally recognized expert in the period between the Testaments, <i>Day of Atonement</i> invites readers into Judea during the tumultuous years leading up to the Maccabean Revolt. It was this pivotal decade that reminded Jews of the centrality of the covenant to their national security and taught them that the covenant was worth dying for. The story is so foundational, it is still told every year at Hanukkah. The lessons learned during this turbulent time also shed light on just what was at stake in the ministry of Jesus, whose radical message seemed to threaten the covenant once again. <br><br> <i>Day of Atonement</i> joins the perennially successful novels <i>Pontius Pilate</i> and <i>The Flames of Rome</i> by renowned historian Paul Maier on Kregel&#x2019;s premier list of captivating and historically accurate biblical novels.</p><p>David A. deSilva is Trustees&#x2019; Distinguished Professor of New Testament and Greek at Ashland Theological Seminary. He is the author of several books, including <i>Unholy Allegiances: Heeding Revelation&#x2019;s Warning; Introducing the Apocrypha;</i> and <i>Honor, Patronage, Kinship &amp; Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture.</i>"David deSilva combines his superb historical knowledge with deep religious understanding and literary sensitivity to create a story that does more than reconstruct the circumstances leading to the Maccabean rebellion. <i>Day of Atonement</i> compellingly explores issues that continue from antiquity to the present: the relationship between faith and politics, the struggle between national identity and cultural assimilation, the zeal of the martyr, the power of faith." (Amy-Jill Levine, professor of New Testament and Jewish studies, Vanderbilt University 2015-06-27)<br><br>"Moving from the Mediterranean coast to Jerusalem, I pass Modein in the low foothills. Here I contemplate, and mystically relive, some dramatic events in our history. I look back westward to the coastal plain and imagine the foreign armies being defeated by Judas Maccabeus. Looking ahead to the Judean hills rising to the east, I often ponder the rededication of the Jerusalem Temple and the inauguration of Hanukkah. All these events spring to light in deSilva&#x2019;s magisterial novel, crafted after decades of walking these hills and reading the historical accounts. History without imagination is dull; with informed sensitivity ancient heroes take on flesh. Echoing now is Ari&#x2019;s question: 'Where are heroes like that now?'" (James H. Charlesworth 2015-06-27)<br><br>"When it comes to the history of Israel or early Christianity, historically sound novels are few and far between. Sometimes a good writer doesn't know his religious history well enough; sometimes a good historian is not a skilled enough writer to pull off page-turner that both educates and entertains. David deSilva's new novel reflects a high level of skill on both counts. Applying his considerable expertise in the intertestamental literature, deSilva provides us with a winsome tale about how Hellenized Jews sought not merely to recover their land from foreign rulers but to 'plunder the Greeks' when it came to art, education, and language. Highly recommended."

Villaine believed it to be a sick joke, but that proved a fatal miscalculation and the crime shocked this fabled region of France. The sinister story that Vanity Fair journalist Maximillian Potter uncovered would lead to a sting operation by some of France's top detectives, the primary suspect's suicide, and a dramatic investigation. This botanical crime threatened to destroy the fiercely traditional culture surrounding the world's greatest wine.<br><br> SHADOWS IN THE VINEYARD takes us deep into a captivating world full of fascinating characters, small-town French politics, an unforgettable narrative, and a local culture defined by the twinned veins of excess and vitality and the deep reverent attention to the land that runs through it.</p><p><b>Maximillian Potter </b>is <i>Esquire</i> magazine's Editor-at-Large.

But functionality and beauty go hand in hand. We've met people who seem afraid to have beautiful things in their cooking space&#x2014;they react in shock and dismay when they see paintings or rugs in a busy kitchen. "What if it gets ruined? That's so nonfunctional!" We couldn't disagree more. Everything in life decays and wears out eventually. Having something you consider beautiful in the kitchen is a nudge toward enjoying the act of cooking, a reminder that food is more than fuel.</p> <p>A beautiful kitchen also helps us remember to clean regularly. When you enjoy your space, even in some small way, it's so much more pleasurable to keep it clean.</p> <p>Once you've worked on your cooking zones and storage capacity, find creative ways to make beauty and functionality go hand in hand. A kitchen you enjoy is one that will motivate you to nourish your household. Here are a few ways to bring a bit of beauty into even the dingiest of kitchens:</p><ul> <li>Enjoy the beauty of food itself. Heap oranges or persimmons in a dish on the countertop (this also will remind you to eat them promptly!). Tomatoes, onions, even sweet potatoes have an earthy beauty that grounds a kitchen. Store herbs with their cut ends in a shallow glass of water, which will keep them fresh and handy for snipping, as well as add a splash of green to your workspace.</li> <li>Cover ugly countertops with a huge butcher block. If you have a tiny and hideous laminate countertop, cover it up with a hefty cutting board, which is more beautiful and also of course very functional.</li> <li>Hang a vibrant work of art. No backsplash? Frame an inexpensive print and hang it behind the stove. Yes, the glass will get greasy eventually, but it's easier to clean glass than a painted wall.</li> <li>Line drawers and cabinets with colorful fabric or paper. Apply fabric wallpaper to the backs of your cabinets using fabric starch; the cloth wallpaper is both washable and removable. Line drawers with pretty paper from an art supply store.</li> <li>Enhance the sense of space with a mirror. A big mirror hung on one wall or over the kitchen table reflects light, helps make up for the lack of a window, and increases the feeling of spaciousness.</li> <li>Lay down a rug. You may think it will get irredeemably dirty, but a patterned rug will hide stains and is easy to vacuum. With a nonslip rug pad beneath, it's also nicer to stand on than hard, cold tile.</li> <li>Adorn the table or windowsill with living plants or fresh flowers. Fresh flowers are a simple grace note for any kitchen. Splurge on them to make your space feel more special, or snip evergreen twigs or even flowering weeds from your backyard or on your walk home. Anything alive makes the kitchen feel more welcoming.</li> <li>Paint! Paint is a major tool for the cook with an ugly, dark kitchen. Don't forget the ceiling, where color can instantly make the room more cheerful (think sky blue, lemon yellow, pale washes of bright colors). Painting the entire room can seem daunting, but with careful cleaning, taping, and priming, you can do an expert job by yourself.</li> <li>Supply music or a radio. The companionship of radio is something we appreciate in our kitchens. Faith keeps a Tivoli radio on her windowsill and listens to NPR and podcasts while she cooks; she plugs in an iPod for dinner parties.</li></ul>SARA KATE GILLINGHAM is a food writer based in New York City.

This period of profound evolution in European thought is credited with transforming the West from medieval to modern and producing the most astonishing outpouring of artistic creation the world has ever known. But what was it? In this masterly work, the incomparable Paul Johnson tells us. He explains the economic, technological, and social developments that provide a backdrop to the age&#x2019;s achievements and focuses closely on the lives and works of its most important figures. A commanding short narrative of this vital period, <i>The Renaissance</i> is also a universally profound meditation on the wellsprings of innovation.</p><p>&#x201c;This wee book packs more information, insight, and historical perspective than do most volumes many times its length.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Forbes</i><br><br>&#x201c;Abound[s] in interesting detail and idiosyncratic judgment.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Johnson does not reduce the art and literature of this immensely rich period to mere by-products of the European economy. . . .

But now Mary Alice's impulsive behavior has land them <em>both</em> in the Birmingham jail!</p><p>It all begins with a call from their good friend Mitzi Phizer, who's starting an investment club -- kind of a Beardstown Ladies group. Patricia Anne is willing to make a small, conservative investment in a thriving chain of HMOs; Mary Alice is hot to trot to put her money on <em>Viagra.</em> But before the club idea gets off the ground, the sisters spot Mitzi's supposedly faithful husband in a chummy little huddle with a redhead -- and the next thing they know, Arthur is accused of murdering the mystery woman. Nothing about the whole sordid story fits the kind, gently Arthur, and Patricia Anne is doing her best to console her good friends. But when their house catches on fire, and Arthur is shot in a place that won't allow him to even sit down at his own murder trial, the sisters know they have to stand up for the poor fellow. And that means checking out everyone -- from low-down cads to highbrow bank presidents -- to find a no good gun-toting arsonist who believes big money is to kill for.</p></p><p>Anne George (c.____ - 2001) was the Agatha Award-winning author of the <em>Southern Sisters</em> mystery series which culminate in <em>Murder Boogies with Elvis</em>, publishing in August 2001. Like Patricia Anne, she was a happily married former school teacher living in Birmingham, Alabama. Ms. George was also a former Alabama State Poet and a regular contributor to literary publications. During her lifetime she was nominated for several awards, including the Pulitzer. Being a true lady of the Old South, her date of birth will forever be a mystery.George's Southern Sisters mysteries, which launched in 1997 with the Agatha Award-winning Murder on a Girl's Night Out, feature two siblings, sensible Patricia Anne Hollowell and rich, erratic Mary Alice Crane. These lifelong residents of Birmingham, Ala., may be in their 60s, but they are still up for a lively bout of sleuthing. As this sixth series entry (after Murder Gets a Life) opens, Arthur Phizer, Patricia Anne's next-door neighbor of 40 years, is accused of murdering his ex-wife by poisoning her at a local restaurant. Patricia Anne can't believe that her mild-mannered neighbor is really a fiendish killer, so she determines to find out who is framing him for murder. Then someone tries to burn down Arthur's house, and a sniper shoots him in the buttocks. George has a sure touch for creating comedic dialogue and believable characters. Her predilection for filling the narrative with brand names can annoy, but this light, amusing romp of a mystery makes good use of the tradition of Southern eccentricity, exuding a properly cozy atmosphere and a nifty web of subplots and domestic complications.

But his is a joyous ennui, if such a thing is possible, one that relishes the boredom of everyday life with a Zen enthusiasm. The title, <i>David Boring</i>, reflects his self-aware humor and captures the essence of an ordinary man living through a larger-than-life story. The main character lives with his best friend, Dot, in a large city, each looking for love and meaning. David in particular is trying to understand his father, whom he knows only through an obscure comic book called "The Yellow Streak." Murder, obsession, sex, and war are all just distractions as he tries to construct a sensible portrait from the odd bits and pieces he finds in his travels. Clowes finds little miracles everywhere he looks--so many, in fact, that they seem hardly to interest him. This detachment perversely makes <i>David Boring</i> deeply compelling and worthy of serious attention from fans and newcomers alike. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Daniel Clowes was born in Chicago in 1961. He is the creator of the comic book <b>Eight-Ball</b>, twenty-one issues of which have been published to date.

As the wind outside whipped up the surface of lake Leman into a cauldron of waves the occupants of the Villa; Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Dr John Polidori, Percy Shelley and Claire Clairmont, whipped themselves into a gothic frenzy with recitals of haunting poetry and ghost stories. The stories that they read came from a book, originally written in German, that had recently been translated into French. The book that they read from was called Fantasmagoriana.

The only takers are two eccentric Englishmen who want to embark for the other side of the globe. The Reverend Geoffrey Wilson believes the Garden of Eden was on the island of Tasmania. His traveling partner, Dr. Thomas Potter, unbeknownst to Wilson, is developing a sinister thesis about the races of men. <br><br>Meanwhile, an aboriginal in Tasmania named Peevay recounts his people&#x2019;s struggles against the invading British, a story that begins in 1824, moves into the present with approach of the English passengers in 1857, and extends into the future in 1870. These characters and many others come together in a storm of voices that vividly bring a past age to life.</p><p>Christopher Columbus was looking for a passage to India when he ran full-tilt boogie into the Americas. One of the narrators of Matthew Kneale's ambitious historical novel <i>English Passengers</i> has more modest aspirations: Captain Illiam Quillian Kewley wants only to smuggle a little tobacco, brandy, and French pornography from the Isle of Mann to a secluded beach in England. Yet somehow in the process, he and his crew end up weighing anchor for Australia. Worse, they're forced to carry three temperamental Englishmen bound for Tasmania on a mission to discover the exact location of the Garden of Eden. The year is 1857, and the study of geology is beginning to make serious inroads into areas of religious doctrine. When the Reverend Geoffrey Wilson runs across a scientific treatise that puts the age of Silurian limestone somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand years, he is scandalized: "This was despite the fact that the Bible tells, and with great clarity, that the earth was created a mere six thousand years ago." His many attempts to prove the Bible's accuracy lead, eventually, to a scientific expedition comprising himself, Timothy Renshaw, a dilettante botanist, and Dr. Thomas Potter. <p> Now jump back 30 years, to 1828, when a revolution of sorts is stirring on the island of Tasmania. Over the years, white settlers have been encroaching on aboriginal land and relations have deteriorated into violence. At the heart of the action is Peevay, a young half-breed abandoned by his aborigine mother, who had been kidnapped and raped by a white escaped convict. Now his vengeful mother is leading a war against the whites, and Peevay, desperate to win her love, has joined her. Chapters from the past narrated by Peevay and augmented by letters and dispatches from white settlers alternate with the sections told by Kewley, Wilson, Renshaw, and Potter. Eventually, of course, the two time lines intersect with momentous results. </p><p> War, mutiny, shipwreck, and not a little farce make <i>English Passengers</i> a gripping read, but it is Matthew Kneale's literary ventriloquism that renders it remarkable. In a novel with so many different points of view, the individuality of each voice stands out. There is, for instance, the mutinous Dr. Potter, whose descent into paranoia and egomania results in diary entries reminiscent of a 19th-century psychotic Bridget Jones: "Manxmen = <i>treacherous</i> even to v. last. Self heard Brew (lashed to mainmast as per usual) instructing helmsman to steer <i>N.N.W.</i> When self questioned he re. this he claiming we = carried into <i>Bay of Biscay</i> by difficult sea currents + must set course to avoid Breton Peninsular. He pointing to distant point of land to N.N.E. claiming this = Brittany. Self = doubtful." But perhaps the most compelling voice in <i>English Passengers</i> belongs to Peevay, who paints a vivid picture of aboriginal life in a foreign tongue he nonetheless makes his own: </p><blockquote> When we sat so in the dark, after our eating, Tartoyen told us stories--secret stories that I will not say even now--about the moon and sun, and how everyone got made, from men and wallaby to seal and kangaroo rat and so. Also he told who was in those rocks and mountains and stars, and how they went there. Until, by and by, I could hear stories as we walked across the world, and divine how it got so, till I knew the world as if he was some family fellow of mine. </blockquote> By the close of this epic tale, the world Peevay had known is gone forever and the lives of the Manx sailors and English passengers have been irrevocably changed. Based on real events in Tasmanian history, Matthew Kneale's novel delivers a home truth about Australia's brutal colonial past, even as it conveys the wonder and allure of the age of exploration. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>"<b>English Passengers</b> is what fiction ought to be: ambitious, narrative-driven, with a story and a quest we don't mind going on.

Each quotation leads to a short meditation on its subject, which in turn leads to a kind of vow the reader can internalize and act upon: "Today, I'll look over the key setbacks of my life. Are some ready to contribute comic color to my writing?"; "Today, I'll take a look at the high road. I will write a little better and a little differently. I will stretch." These tender morsels are best taken like vitamins: one a day. They will encourage, inspire, amuse, and provoke, but mostly they will make you start writing. After all, warns Shaughnessy in the introduction, "The writing you don't do today is lost forever."</p><h2>Foundations of Contemporary Interpretation</h2><p><p>Foundations of Contemporary Interpretation seeks to identify and clarify the basic problems of interpretation that affect our reading of the Bible today.

Drawing on a wide array of primary sources&#x2015;from slaveowners' diaries to children's daybooks to racist broadsides&#x2015;Joanne Pope Melish reveals not only how northern society changed but how its perceptions changed as well. </p><p>Melish explores the origins of racial thinking and practices to show how ill-prepared the region was to accept a population of free people of color in its midst. Because emancipation was gradual, whites transferred prejudices shaped by slavery to their relations with free people of color, and their attitudes were buttressed by abolitionist rhetoric which seemed to promise riddance of slaves as much as slavery. She tells how whites came to blame the impoverished condition of people of color on their innate inferiority, how racialization became an important component of New England ante-bellum nationalism, and how former slaves actively participated in this discourse by emphasizing their African identity.</p><p>Placing race at the center of New England history, Melish contends that slavery was important not only as a labor system but also as an institutionalized set of relations. The collective amnesia about local slavery's existence became a significant component of New England regional identity.</p></p><p><p>Joanne Pope Melish is Associate Professor of History at the University of Kentucky.</p><p>"Joanne Melish sheds more fresh light on the significance of slavery in the North than any other historian I can think of. <i>Disowning Slavery</i> is a brilliant book."</p> (David Brion Davis, author of <i>The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution</i>)</p><h2>Emma And The Outlaw</h2><p>Despite her unconventional upbringing -- she'd been adopted off the orphan train by the local "madam" -- Emma Chalmers was the most prim and proper young lady in all of Whitneyville.

She then hastily dried her eyes with a wadded handkerchief trimmed in blue tatting and smoothed the skirts of her prim brown sateen dress.<br><br>Grabbing up a new supply of posters she'd just had printed over at the newspaper office, Emma dashed for the door. The Whitneyville Lending Library was empty, and she didn't bother to lock up, since no one she knew would have stooped so low as to steal a book, and she'd collected only two cents in fines.<br><br>She saw a slim figure reflected back to her as she passed the spotless windows of the general store. Emma quickened her steps, as it had been her experience that some of the conductors and stagecoach drivers would evade her if given the opportunity.<br><br>As she passed the Yellow Belly Saloon, with its peeling paint and sagging porch, the smells of whiskey and sawdust and beer and sweat came out to wrap themselves around her like an insidious vine. Emma broke into a ladylike sprint, clutching her posters to her shapely bosom with one hand and keeping her skirts out of the dirt and tobacco juice on the sidewalk with the other. Her bright hair, pulled into a single thick plait, swung as she ran.<br><br>The railroad yard was crowded with arriving and departing passengers. Most were human, but there were some pigs and horses and an occasional crate of squawking chickens.<br><br>Emma picked her way through the throng as daintily as she could, and with a practiced eye sought out the conductor. A well-fed man with a ruddy complexion and thick white hair, he was half-hidden behind a shipment of canned meats bound for the general store.<br><br>After clearing her throat, a sound barely discernible in the din, Emma approached. "Good afternoon, Mr. Lathrop," she said politely.<br><br>"Miss Emma," Mr. Lathrop answered with a nod of his bushy head. His blue eyes revealed both kindness and apprehension. "I'm afraid there's no news today. It just seems like nobody in this whole part of the country knows anything about your sisters."<br><br>Even though she'd expected this answer -- after all, she'd gotten virtually the same one every week for nearly thirteen years -- Emma was stricken, for a moment, with the purest of sorrow. "If -- if you would just pass these bills out, as you go along -- "<br><br>Mr. Lathrop accepted the stack of crisply printed placards and held one up, with great ceremony, for his pensive perusal. It read:<br><br>REWARD! $500 CASH!<br><br>For any information leading<br><br>to the location of MISS CAROLINE CHALMERS,<br><br>dark of hair and eyes, or<br><br>MISS LILY CHALMERS, fair, and having brown eyes.<br><br>Please contact MISS EMMA CHALMERS<br><br>In care of the Whitneyville Lending Library<br><br>Whitneyville, Idaho Territory<br><br>"Perhaps I should have said 'thank you'," Emma fretted, bending around Mr. Lathrop's ample shoulder to read the bold print.<br><br>The conductor smiled gently. "I figure it's plain enough that you'd be grateful for any help, Miss Emma."<br><br>She sighed. "Sometimes it just seems hopeless. Sort of like the ending of <i>Anna Karenina.</i> Have you read that book, Mr. Lathrop?"<br><br>He looked bewildered. "Not so as I remember, Miss Emma. A man doesn't get much chance to read when he spends his days on the rails."<br><br>Emma nodded soberly as she handed over the rest of the posters. "I suppose not. The noise would be powerfully distracting, I should think."<br><br>It was Mr. Lathrop's solemn duty to see that pigs and people found their proper places aboard the train. Therefore, he left Emma, her posters in his arms, after favoring her with a little tip of his hat. Every Christmas, Emma remembered him with a pair of knitted socks and a box of walnut fudge, and she wondered now if that was proper recompense for a man who had tried so steadfastly to be helpful.<br><br>Pausing for just a moment, Emma scanned the arriving and departing passengers, for she'd never stopped hoping to find one of her sisters among them. Walking alongside the track, she nearly collided with a ramp extending from one of the boxcars.<br><br>Not to mention the man and horse coming <i>down</i> that ramp.<br><br>Emma gave a startled gasp and leaped backwards, while the man smiled at her from the saddle and touched the brim of his battered hat. He looked like a seedy saddlebum, with no gentle qualities to recommend him, and yet Emma felt a not unpleasant tug in the pit of her stomach as she returned his regard.<br><br>"You ought to look where you're going," she said crisply.<br><br>Controlling his mount with barely perceptible movements of his gloved hands, the stranger urged the nervous horse into the dirt and cinders at the side of the tracks. Apparently, he found the fact that Emma had taken umbrage very amusing, because he was still grinning, his teeth wickedly white against a sun-browned, beard-stubbled face.<br><br>He gave a mocking bow from the waist. "My apologies, your ladyship," he said. Then he let out a low hoot of laughter and rode off.<br><br>Emma smoothed her hair, then sighed as she lifted her skirts and started back the way she'd come. It seemed to her that no one bothered to cultivate good manners any longer.<br><br>Because something about the man on the horse had disturbed her, Emma forcibly shifted her mind to the search for her sisters. Even if she came face to face with Lily or Caroline, she thought in despair, she might not recognize them. People could change so much in thirteen years. They would be grown women now.<br><br>Emma did not come out of her reverie until she was passing the First Territorial Bank. Through the window, she spotted Fulton Whitney, who made no secret of the fact that he aspired to be her husband. He was tall and blond and he looked very handsome in his gray pin-striped trousers, with a vest over his white linen shirt, and there was a gentlemanly garter on his sleeve.<br><br>He smiled distractedly at Emma's wave, and she went on walking, knowing Fulton would be displeased if she slipped inside the bank to speak to him. Business was business, he always said, and Emma belonged to another part of his life.<br><br>Emma frowned as she continued along the sidewalk. Sometimes Fulton made her feel like a straw hat stuck away on a wardrobe shelf for the winter, and it worried her that her pulse never quickened when she looked at him.<br><br>Lifting her skirts again, Emma looked both ways and then crossed the road, wishing to avoid further contact with the Yellow Belly Saloon. It was so much pleasanter to look at the shining blue waters of Crystal Lake, hardly more than a stone's throw from the main street of town.<br><br>Fulton firmly believed that Whitneyville would someday be a thriving resort city because of that enormous and beautiful lake, and he'd invested his money accordingly. Chloe had chosen the town for the same reason.<br><br>Cheery music flowed from the Stardust Saloon, and Emma marked the spritely beat with small movements of her head while she hurried on to the library. She found the place empty, as usual, and was just putting <i>Anna Karenina</i> back on the shelf when a thunderous explosion rocked the walls and rattled the windows in their frames.<br><br>Emma's heart did a startled double beat as she hurried to the front door to look out, fully expecting to see the Lord Himself riding on a cloud above, surrounded by His angels. The world had ended, and it only remained to be seen whether she would be taken to heaven or left behind to swim in a lake of fire.<br><br>But there wasn't a cloud in the sky, and there was certainly no sign of the Lord. Emma was quite relieved, for there were those who said she was as much a sinner as Chloe and there might not have been space for her in Glory.<br><br>People were running past her in the street, and shouts of excitement rose all around. The fire bell was clanging, and Emma caught the acrid scent of smoke.<br><br>She hadn't moved more than three or four steps when she realized that the Yellow Belly Saloon was nearly in ruins. Its front had completely disappeared, showing the men inside draped over tables like rag dolls forgotten in a playhouse. And there was a fire, picking up momentum with every passing second.<br><br>For all the clanging clamor of the bell, Emma could see no sign of the fire wagon, with its long hoses and special pump. She pressed closer to watch as townsmen dragged the injured out into the crowded street.<br><br>"Get back!" shouted Doc Waverly, who had never been known for his patient nature. "Get back, damn it, and give these poor bastards some air!"<br><br>Emma's cheeks heated at the doctor's language, but she remained where she was. It was as though she were helping somehow, just by being there.<br><br>Although she stood on tiptoe, she couldn't get a good look at any of the wounded men, but she did see Chloe and her girls flowing across the street from the Stardust Saloon in a river of brightly colored silks and satins.<br><br>"What the hell happened here, Doc?" Ethan Peters, the editor of the <i>Whitneyville Orator,</i> wanted to know.<br><br>"I've got no idea," answered the bristly old man who had been mending broken limbs and removing bullets and infected toenails in Whitneyville almost since the day of its founding, "and don't get in our way. When somebody knows the story, we'll damned well tell you about it!"<br><br>Emma bit her lip briefly as she watched some of the men carrying the wounded, under Doc Waverly's supervision, into the Stardust Saloon. She got as close as she could, but even now, at the age of twenty, Emma didn't dare defy Chloe's standing order that she never set foot inside the place.<br><br>She waited on the sidewalk until all the excitement had died down, until the smoldering remains of the Yellow Belly Saloon were drenched in water pumped from the lake, and then she went slowly back to the library.<br><br>Emma stayed there until closing time, cataloging books and consuming a page or two of <i>Little Women</i> whenever she got the chance. People came in and out all afternoon, but none of them seemed to know any more about the calamity at the Yellow Belly Saloon than Emma did.<br><br>At five o'clock sharp she closed the library door, locked it with a long brass key, and set out for home. If there was one person in the whole town, besides Doc, who would know the complete story, it was Chloe.<br><br>A fine film of sweat lay over Steven Fairfax's body when he came to. He saw a papered wall with blue flowers on it, and a pair of lace curtains that seemed to be trying to blend into each other. He started to sit up, but the pain stopped him, squeezing his ribcage like a giant fist.<br><br>He fell back onto the pillows with a muttered curse and felt at his hip for the Colt .45 he was never without. It was gone, holster and all.<br><br>His first instinct was to bellow a protest, but he stopped himself. After all, he didn't know exactly where he was, or what had happened to him. There was a damn good chance that his half brother, Macon, had finally caught up with him.<br><br>Breathing hard, he tried to think. To remember. Slowly, the events of the day began to come back to him.<br><br>He'd come into town on the train, left his horse in a livery stable, and looked for a place to have a drink and wash the soot from his throat. He'd wandered into a hole called the Yellow Belly, partly because its name had made him smile, and partly because he was too damned dirty for the Stardust, which looked like it might offer gentler comforts.<br><br>He'd ordered a whiskey and sat down alone at a table in the rear, following his rule of always keeping his back to the wall so no one could sneak up behind him. He'd learned that lesson in the war, and it had stood him in good stead ever since.<br><br>Steven hadn't taken more than a few sips of his whiskey -- he remembered a slight chagrin at the realization that a glass of cold lemonade would have tasted better -- when the drunk weaved in through a back entrance, singing at the top of his lungs. Nobody had paid much attention, including Steven.<br><br>It was only when the man climbed up onto a table and started singing a birthday song that Steven began to take notice. The old codger was holding a stick of dynamite in one hand. "This here's my birthday," he announced to the quiet revelers. Then, incredibly, he struck a match to the sole of his boot and lit the short fuse of the dynamite. When the men around him lunged for him, he was alternately singing to himself and puffing ineffectually at the flaming fuse, as though it were a candle on a cake.<br><br>One of the men managed to get hold of the dynamite stick and fling it away, but Steven couldn't remember much beyond that, except for an earsplitting noise, pain, and then blinding darkness.<br><br>He had to know where he was now.<br><br>He lifted his head from the soft pillow, which smelled pleasantly of starch and fresh air. "Hello? Somebody? Anybody!"<br><br>No one answered his call. Maybe this was a hotel room, instead of a house. Steven tried to roll onto his side to get a better look, but the pain was too strong. It pressed him onto his back again.<br><br>He was fighting to keep from losing consciousness when the door opened and a stranger walked in. Steven would have drawn on him if he'd had his .45, instead, his hand slapped uselessly against his thigh.<br><br>"Relax, son," said the old man, and Steven finally noticed that he was carrying a battered doctor's bag. "I'm here to help you."<br><br>"Where's my forty-five?" Steven rasped.<br><br>The doctor shrugged. "Wherever Chloe puts guns, I suppose," he answered. He was a paunchy middle-aged man with a balding pate, and he wore gold-rimmed spectacles on the end of his nose. "You won't need any firearms here. What's your name, boy?"<br><br>Steven tried to think of an alias and found that he couldn't. His brain was like frozen horseshit. "Steven Fairfax," he admitted. "And I'm not a boy, damn it. I fought in the war, same as you probably did."<br><br>His bristly response brought a smile from the doctor, who was setting his bag on a table beside Steven's bed.<br><br>"Name's Dr. Waverly," he said, "but you can call me Doc. Are you in a lot of pain?"<br><br>Steven glared up at him. "Hell, no, you damned Yankee -- I never felt better in my life!"<br><br>Doc laughed at that. "Spare me the Rebel yells, Johnny. The war's been over for a long time." He was filling a syringe, holding it up to the light from the window with the lace curtains. "What brings you to Whitneyville?"<br><br>"I'm just passing through," Steven answered grudgingly. "And you keep that needle away from me."<br><br>The doctor smiled again. "Sorry, Reb. It just so happens that I'm giving the orders around here. Luckily for you, I'm on your side."<br><br>Steven's shirt was in rags on his chest, and the doctor had an easy time finding a place on his upper arm to swab with cool alcohol. The pain wouldn't allow him to struggle, so he endured the puncture of the needle.<br><br>"Just a little morphine," Doc Waverly said. "We've got to move you and wrap those ribs of yours, not to mention taking a few stitches here and there. Believe me, you'll be happier asleep."<br><br>Steven was already being pushed into a dark corner of his mind. Resisting the stuff was no good; it had him, dead to rights.<br><br>He felt himself drifting, though, and for a while he was aware of momentary stabs of pain. Then, suddenly, he was back at Fairhaven, his father's house outside of New Orleans, and he was a boy again.<br><br>He and Maman were sitting in a carriage on the road, admiring the palatial white house in the distance. It had brick walks and sprawling green lawns, and he could se...</p><h2>Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege (American Philosophy)</h2><p><p>"[A] lucid discussion of race that does not sell out the black experience." &#x2015;Tommy Lott, author of The Invention of Race</p><p>Revealing Whiteness explores how white privilege operates as an unseen, invisible, and unquestioned norm in society today. In this personal and selfsearching book, Shannon Sullivan interrogates her own whiteness and how being white has affected her. By looking closely at the subtleties of white domination, she issues a call for other white people to own up to their unspoken privilege and confront environments that condone or perpetuate it. Sullivan&#x2019;s theorizing about race and privilege draws on American pragmatism, psychology, race theory, and feminist thought. As it articulates a way to live beyond the barriers that white privilege has created, this book offers readers a clear and honest confrontation with a trenchant and vexing concern.</p></p><p>2007 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award, Honorable Mention<p>Shannon Sullivan is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania State University and Associate Director of the Rock Ethics Institute.

Not least affected was the experience of time itself: ever-accelerating change left people with briefer intervals of time in which to gather new experiences and adapt. In this provocative and erudite book Reinhart Koselleck, a distinguished philosopher of history, explores the concept of historical time by posing the question: what kind of experience is opened up by the emergence of modernity? Relying on an extraordinary array of witnesses and texts from politicians, philosophers, theologians, and poets to Renaissance paintings and the dreams of German citizens during the Third Reich, Koselleck shows that, with the advent of modernity, the past and the future became &#39;relocated&#39; in relation to each other.The promises of modernity -freedom, progress, infinite human improvement -produced a world accelerating toward an unknown and unknowable future within which awaited the possibility of achieving utopian fulfillment. History, Koselleck asserts, emerged in this crucial moment as a new temporality providing distinctly new ways of assimilating experience. In the present context of globalization and its resulting crises, the modern world once again faces a crisis in aligning the experience of past and present. To realize that each present was once an imagined future may help us once again place ourselves within a temporality organized by human thought and humane ends as much as by the contingencies of uncontrolled events.</p><p>With a new, interpretive introduction by the translator, this revised edition of Koselleck&#39;s most acclaimed work is once again available in English.

Armed with the new Panther tank, Hitler and Field Marshal von Manstein were confident that they could inflict another crushing defeat on the Soviet Union. What they did not know is that the Soviets knew about the coming attack, and they were ready.</p><p>This book focuses on the southern front of this campaign, which featured the one of the biggest clashes of armor of the war, as over a thousand tanks clashed in the battle of Prokhorovka.

The Commission was given the further task of laying out an agenda for developing better measures.<br> <br> <i>Mismeasuring Our Lives</i> is the result of this major intellectual effort, one with pressing relevance for anyone engaged in assessing how and whether our economy is serving the needs of our society. The authors offer a sweeping assessment of the limits of GDP as a measurement of the well-being of societies considering, for example, how GDP overlooks economic inequality (with the result that most people can be worse off even though average income is increasing); and does not factor environmental impacts into economic decisions.<br> <br>In place of GDP, <i>Mismeasuring Our Lives</i> introduces a bold new array of concepts, from sustainable measures of economic welfare, to measures of savings and wealth, to a green GDP.&#x201d; At a time when policymakers worldwide are grappling with unprecedented global financial and environmental issues, here is an essential guide to measuring the things that matter.<br></p><p><p><strong>Joseph E.

She fears she's made a dreadful mistake when Gabriel sweeps her into his arms and passionately embraces her. Yet it's a kiss that seals her fate. Now Gabriel <i>must</i> possess her -- even if he has to slay a dragon to do it!<br><br>*A <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</p><p>Amanda Quick, a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, is a bestselling, award-winning author of contemporary and historical romances.

She makes her home in the Pacific Northwest with her husband, Frank.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Moonlight suited him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cloaked in the silver light that illuminated the meadow, Gabriel Banner, Earl of Wylde, looked as mysterious and as dangerous as a legend that had come to life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Phoebe Layton brought her mare to a halt at the edge of the trees and held her breath as Wylde rode toward her. She tried to steady her hands as she gripped the reins. This was no time to lose her nerve. She was a lady on a quest.<br> &nbsp;<br> She needed the services of a knight-errant and it was not as though she had a great deal of choice. Indeed, Wylde was the only candidate she knew who had the proper qualifications. But first she had to talk him into accepting the position.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had been working on that project for weeks. Until tonight the solitary, reclusive earl had steadfastly ignored all her deliberately intriguing letters. In desperation, she had resorted to other tactics. In an effort to lure him forth from his lair, she had baited a trap using the one tempting morsel she knew he could not resist.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fact that he was here tonight on this lonely country lane in Sussex meant that she had at last succeeded in provoking him into a meeting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wylde did not know who she was. In her letters she had signed herself only as The Veiled Lady. Phoebe regretted the small deception, but it had been a necessary maneuver. If Wylde had been aware of her true identity at the start of the venture, he would most certainly have refused to help her. He had to be persuaded to take up the quest before she dared reveal herself. Phoebe was certain that once he understood everything, he would comprehend the reasons for her initial secrecy.<br> &nbsp;<br> No, Wylde did not know her, but Phoebe knew him.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had not seen him in nearly eight years. At sixteen she had imagined him a living legend, a noble, valiant knight straight out of a medieval romance. In her young eyes all he had lacked was the shining armor and a sword.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Phoebe clearly recalled the last time she had seen him, she knew Gabriel had no recollection of it at all. He had been too busy plotting to run off with her sister, Meredith, at the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Phoebe tensed with curiosity now as he rode toward her. Unfortunately, the combination of the veil she was wearing and the pale moonlight made it impossible to tell just how much he had changed over the years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her first thought was that he seemed larger than she remembered. Taller. Leaner. Harder, somehow. His shoulders appeared broader under the caped greatcoat he wore. Snug breeches outlined the strong, muscular lines of his thighs. The curled brim of his hat cast Wylde&#x2019;s features into a forbidding, impenetrable shadow.<br> &nbsp;<br> For an unsettling moment Phoebe wondered if this was the wrong man. Perhaps she was about to encounter a genuine villain, a highwayman or worse. She stirred uneasily in the saddle. If she came to grief this night, her poor, beleaguered family would no doubt feel justified in having her tombstone engraved with something fitting, SHE FINALLY PAID THE PRICE OF HER RECKLESS WAYS would do nicely. As far as her over-protective clan was concerned, Phoebe had spent her entire life getting into one scrape after another. This time she might have taken one chance too many.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The mysterious Veiled Lady, I presume?&#x201d; Gabriel inquired coldly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Relief washed over her. Phoebe&#x2019;s doubts as to the man&#x2019;s identity were instantly resolved. There was no mistaking those dark, gritty tones even though she had not heard them in eight years. What startled her was the small thrill of anticipation they sent through her. She frowned briefly at her strange reaction.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good evening, my lord,&#x201d; she said.<br> Gabriel brought his black stallion to a halt a few feet away. &#x201c;I received your most recent note, madam. I found it extremely irritating, just as I did the others.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Phoebe swallowed uneasily as she realized he was not in a cheerful mood. &#x201c;I had rather hoped to pique your interest, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have a strong distaste for deception.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Phoebe&#x2019;s heart sank. A strong distaste for deception. She suddenly wondered if she had made a serious tactical mistake in dealing with Wylde. Just as well she had been careful to go veiled tonight, she thought. She certainly did not want him to discover who she was if this night&#x2019;s work came to naught. &#x201c;Nevertheless, I am pleased you decided to accept my invitation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Curiosity got the better of me.&#x201d; Gabriel smiled faintly in the moonlight, but the curve of his mouth held no warmth and his shadowed gaze revealed nothing. &#x201c;You have become a thorn in my side during the past two months, madam. I expect you are well aware of that fact.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I apologize,&#x201d; Phoebe said earnestly. &#x201c;But the truth is, I was becoming quite desperate, my lord. You are a difficult man to see. You did not respond to my initial letters and as you do not go into Society, I could think of no other way to gain your attention.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So you decided to deliberately provoke me to such an extent that I would finally bestir myself to meet you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Phoebe took a deep breath. &#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is generally considered dangerous to annoy me, my mysterious Veiled Lady.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She did not doubt that for a moment, but it was too late to retreat now. She had come too far to call a halt to this night&#x2019;s venture. She was a lady on a quest and she must be stouthearted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that so, my lord?&#x201d; Phoebe tried for a cool amused tone. &#x201c;The thing is, you left me no alternative. Never fear, I am certain that once you have heard what I have to say, you will be glad you finally agreed to meet me and I know you will forgive our small deception.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you have summoned me so that you can gloat over your latest triumph, I should warn you I do not like to lose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Triumph?&#x201d; She blinked behind the veil and then realized he was talking about the bait she had used to draw him here tonight. &#x201c;Oh, yes, the book. Come now, my lord. You are as eager to see the manuscript as I am. Obviously you could not resist my invitation to view it, even though I am the new owner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gabriel stroked his stallion&#x2019;s neck with a gloved hand. &#x201c;We appear to share a mutual interest in medieval manuscripts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;True. I see that it annoys you that I am the one who located The Knight and the Sorcerer and discovered that it was for sale,&#x201d; Phoebe said. &#x201c;But surely you are generous enough to give me credit for the cleverness of my investigations. The manuscript was right here in Sussex, after all, practically beneath your very nose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gabriel inclined his head in acknowledgment of her skills. &#x201c;You seem to be rather lucky in that regard. This is the third such manuscript you have gotten to ahead of me in recent weeks. May I ask why you didn&#x2019;t simply snatch it up and carry it off, the way you did the others?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because as I explained in my letters, I wish to speak to you, sir.&#x201d; Phoebe hesitated and then admitted in a soft rush, &#x201c;And because, to be quite honest, I decided it might be wise to take an escort with me tonight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Nash is a very odd sort of man, even for a book collector,&#x201d; Phoebe continued. &#x201c;The stipulations he put on the time at which he would turn over the manuscript made me rather uneasy. I do not like doing business at midnight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nash sounds somewhat more than merely amusingly eccentric,&#x201d; Gabriel agreed thoughtfully.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He claims to be nocturnal, rather like a bat. He says in his letters that his household is run on a schedule that is opposite to that of the rest of the world. He sleeps while others are awake and works while others sleep. Very strange, is it not?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He would no doubt fit very nicely into the Polite World,&#x201d; Gabriel said dryly. &#x201c;Most of the ton stays out all night and sleeps during the day. Still, you were probably right to be careful about meeting him alone at midnight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Phoebe smiled. &#x201c;I am glad you approve of my plan to take an escort.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I approve, but I confess I&#x2019;m surprised by your concern,&#x201d; Gabriel said with the precision of a swordsman sliding his blade home. &#x201c;You have not thus far demonstrated much inclination toward caution and prudence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Phoebe&#x2019;s cheeks burned at the sarcasm. &#x201c;When one is on a quest, one must be bold, my lord.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You consider yourself on a quest?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, my lord, I do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see. Speaking of quests, I should tell you that I am here tonight on a small one of my own.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A chill of apprehension seized Phoebe. &#x201c;Yes, my lord? What would that be?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was not just the prospect of viewing Nash&#x2019;s manuscript before you take possession of it that brings me here, my Veiled Lady.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;</p><h2>Wicked Bronze Ambition: A Garrett, P.I., Novel</h2><p><i>Garrett is a human detective in the fantastical city of TunFaire.

She lives with her family and their many animals in Maryland.</p><p>www.talesofedbaker.com</p>Grade 4-6-An amusing fairy-tale adventure that takes the frog-turned-prince story a little further. Princess Emeralda is incredibly clumsy, she brays like a donkey when she laughs, and she would rather spend time outdoors or learning magic from her witch-aunt Grassina than marry self-centered Prince Jorge. When she runs off to the nearby swamp, she meets "Frog" who, naturally, claims to be an enchanted prince and begs her for a spell-breaking kiss. But when she finally complies, something goes terribly wrong, and suddenly Emma is a green-skinned, pond-hopping frog. She and Eadric spend the rest of the book trying to undo the spells that have bewitched them, struggling to avoid a dragon, a frog-eating dog, and an inept angry witch along the way. When they are finally released from their enchantments, it's clear they will live a happy-if rather unconventional-life together. Baker's characters, especially Emma and Eadric, are more than meets the eye. The tale moves at a good pace, and, though the happy ending is predictable, the trials and tribulations that precede it are interesting. However, it's difficult to determine the book's audience. While the story would appeal to primary to intermediate grade girls, the vocabulary is rather sophisticated and seems to be more suited to young adults. Perhaps it would work best as a read-aloud. For fairy-tale themes more in tune with their specific audiences, turn to Donna Jo Napoli's The Prince of the Pond (Dutton, 1992) for intermediates, and her Zel (Puffin, 1998) or Beast (Atheneum, 2000) for the older crowd. <br> <i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i> <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman</h2><p>The Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman tells the story of one of America&#39;s most influential and imaginative dissidents, a major figure in the 1960s counterculture and anti-war movement who remained a dedicated political organizer right up until his death in 1989.

This is primarily a book about her work; it has a comprehensive gallery section, but it includes some insight into Ann's method of working and very good advice about planning and executing your own piece of landscape art in fabric. There is a great step by step guide to recreating one of Ann's pieces, she bonds freehand cut strips of patchwork fabric to fusible web to build backgrounds and then adds foreground detail with further textures and a form of confetti quilting. There's a lot of free motion embroidery involved in this technique, but it is fairly unstructured, so even if you're a little unconfident in that area, you're still likely to achieve a great result.

His determination to follow the teachings of the Master has cost the life of one friend and sent three others to a Roman prison to await execution. How can he stay true to the teachings of Jesus, which require that he love his enemies, and yet deliver the friends who face death because of him? A similar dilemma faces Miriam of Jerusalem. Her father, along with the other leaders of the powerful Sanhedrin, are determined to stamp out the growing popularity of this itinerant preacher from Nazareth. But Miriam too has found Jesus to be far more than a mere man, and this poses a terrible choice for her will she follow family or faith?

Hothouse children, they are all musically talented, but they cannot be protected from the world for long. Jonah becomes a successful young tenor, but the world of opera can only accept him as a &#39;brilliant Negro singer&#39;; Joseph, our narrator, becomes a pianist and devotes his talents to the service of his brother&#39;s; Ruth turns her back on classical music (&#39;white music&#39;) and disappears, on the run with her black husband under suspicion of being a Black Panther.</p><p>In some respects, Richard Powers's <i>The Time of Our Singing</i> is just a big, absorbing drama about an American family, with the typical ingredients of an immigrant parent and some social obstacles--in this case, a biracial marriage in the Civil Rights era--to be overcome by the talented children. But Powers's lyrical gifts lift this material far above its familiar subject matter. His descriptions of music alone will transport the reader. The Strom family were raised with this common language: "Our parents' Crazed Quotations game played on the notion that every moment's tune had all history's music box for its counterpoint. On any evening in Hamilton Heights, we could jump from organum to atonality without any hint of all the centuries that had died fiery deaths between them." The central figure of this novel is the dazzling Jonah, who makes a life from singing, and who may be the only person around him who regards his racial heritage as irrelevant to his ambitions. Powers's is such a fertile writer, however, that he can't stay with any single story, but plunges into pages and pages of family and social histories. The result is a rambling, resonant, fearless novel that pulls the reader along in its wake. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Richard Powers is a recipient of a MacArthur award (commonly referred to as &#39;genius grants&#39;).

These words spoken by the Blessed and transcribed for her by Klemens Brentano have been a source of inspiration to many, including Fr. Gerard Manley Hopkins, Jacques and Raissa Maritain, and Mel Gibson in his writing of &#x201c;The Passion of the Christ.&#x201d; The material is arranged in such a way as to facilitate the praying of the Stations of the Cross by the faithful. The second fall of Jesus (traditionally the 7th Station) is combined with the 4th Station in Blessed Anne Catherine&#x2019;s visions; and the third fall of Jesus (traditionally the 9th Station) is combined with the 5th Station. Thus, the Stations of the Cross presented here are twelve in number, though all fourteen traditional Stations are represented within the twelve.</p><p></p><h2>Soul Agreements</h2><p><p>While in spirit, before you were born, you wrote a script for your life on earth that included soul agreements establishing your relationships with your parents, lovers, children, and others who would affect your life in meaningful ways. Your career directions were planned out, as well as the major challenges you would encounter. This karmic road map was programmed at a soul level and can be examined by psychic researchers like Dick and Tara Sutphen.</p><p>In his bestselling book, <em>You Were Born Again to Be Together</em>, Dick explored the concept of destiny through romantic relationships. In <em>Soul Agreements</em> his investigations expand to a variety of cases: a woman born with a severe disability; a couple who came together to experience tragedy; and others who incarnated to be famous, or influential, or to become healers.</p><p>Once you understand how soul agreements work, Dick teaches how to make the most of your destiny. The more self-actualized you are, the less likely you will be adversely affected by negative life experiences. This awareness shows you how to best override fate and create your own reality of love and success.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Soldier on the Southern Front: The Classic Italian Memoir of World War 1</h2><p>A rediscovered Italian masterpiece chronicling the author's experience as an infantryman, newly translated and reissued to commemorate the centennial of World War I. Taking its place alongside works by Ernst J&#x178;nger, Robert Graves, and Erich Maria Remarque, Emilio Lussu's memoir is one of the most affecting accounts to come out of the First World War. A classic in Italy but virtually unknown in the English-speaking world, it reveals, in spare and detached prose, the almost farcical side of the war as seen by a Sardinian officer fighting the Austrian army on the Asiago plateau in northeastern Italy, the alpine front so poignantly evoked by Ernest Hemingway in <i>A Farewell to Arms.<br></i><br>For Lussu, June 1916 to July 1917 was a year of continuous assaults on impregnable trenches, absurd missions concocted by commanders full of patriotic rhetoric and vanity but lacking in tactical skill, and episodes often tragic and sometimes grotesque, where the incompetence of his own side was as dangerous as the attacks waged by the enemy. A rare firsthand account of the Italian front, Lussu's memoir succeeds in staging a fierce indictment of the futility of war in a dry, often ironic style that sets his tale wholly apart from the Western Front of Remarque and adds an astonishingly modern voice to the literature of the Great War.</p><p><b>Emilio Lussu</b> (1890-1975) served as an infantry officer in WWI and was decorated several times for valor. A fervent antifascist, he spent much of the 1920s in exile in France, fought in Spain against Franco, and returned to Italy in 1943 to join the resistance. <b>Mark Thompson</b> is an award-winning British historian. He is the author, most recently, of <i>The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front</i>, 1915-1919."This beautiful, harrowing, moving, occasionally comic memoir of the experiences&nbsp;of the Sardinian writer, Emilio Lussu, on the Italian-Austrian front...in the&nbsp;First World War has remained largely unknown to English-speaking readers. ...Its republication in a new translation...means it should now find a place on&nbsp;the bookshelf alongside Robert Graves and Erich Maria Remarque." -<i>Times Literary Supplement<br></i><br>"Any avid student of history, particularly military history, will be enthralled with <i>A Soldier on the Southern Front</i>...this book will not soon be forgotten." -<i>New York Journal of Books<br></i><br>"The recovered memoir of a brave Italian soldier in World War I. It is a story of trench warfare in 1916, but more importantly, it is the story of the men who fought and their derision of their commanding officers. The author&#x2019;s memory is vivid, and the characters demand it. The author writes about a war of maneuver to save lives rather than a war of position that would cost them. Lussu&#x2019;s philosophy of war was born in the days he lived through and wrote about." -<i>Kirkus Reviews<br></i><br>"Part lyrical Italian mojo, part authorial descriptive genius, part 100-year-old stoicism, this eminently readable book ungraphically describes the infantry experience." -<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"...Emilio Lussu&#x2019;s <i>A Soldier on the Southern Front</i>, stands as a closely observed critique of wartime generalship that is demonstrably inadequate to the task at hand...Lussu&#x2019;s own recollections of combat stand out, because he retains throughout a tone of remarkable dispassion even while recording instances of senior officer ineptitude likely to mortify even the most obdurate donkey.&nbsp;<br><i>Soldier </i>recounts a single year in the combat history of the Sardinian brigade to which Lussu was assigned throughout the war...by stitching together a series of loosely-related episodes, Lussu provides a detailed and compelling picture of what it was like to fight the Austrian army in the mountains of northern Italy. Mostly, it was miserable. As on the Western Front so too on the Southern one: Service in the trenches combined filth, deprivation, exhaustion, and periodic terror, reinforced by an acute awareness of being at the mercy of forces utterly without mercy." <i>-</i>Andrew Bacevich in<i> <i>Raritan</i><br></i></p><h2>Gargoyles: A Novel</h2><p><p>The playwright and novelist Thomas Bernhard was one of the most widely translated and admired writers of his generation, winner of the three most coveted literary prizes in Germany. <i>Gargoyles, </i>one of his earliest novels, is a singular, surreal study of the nature of humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One morning a doctor and his son set out on daily rounds through the grim mountainous Austrian countryside. They observe the colorful characters they encounter&#x2014;from an innkeeper whose wife has been murdered to a crippled musical prodigy kept in a cage&#x2014;coping with physical misery, madness, and the brutality of the austere landscape. The parade of human grotesques culminates in a hundred-page monologue by an eccentric, paranoid prince, a relentlessly flowing cascade of words that is classic Bernhard.</p></p><p>Early one morning a doctor sets out with his son on his daily rounds through the forbidding moutainouse countryside. Their visits, a succession of grotesque portraits- a diabetic industrialist living in incestuous isolation with his half-sister; three brothers, occupying a mill set in a deep gorge, who have just strangled a bevy of exotic birds; a crippled musical prodigy whose sister locks him in a cage- lead them to a castle and a paranoid prince, whose &#39;almost uninterrupted monologue for a hundred pages is a virtuoso verbal performance...an extraordinary, somber first novel.THOMAS BERNHARD was born in Holland in 1931 and grew up in Austria. He studied music at the Akademie Mozarteum in Salzburg. In 1957 he began a second career, as a playwright, poet, and novelist. The winner of the three most distinguished and coveted literary prizes awarded in Germany, he has become one of the most widely translated and admired writers of his generation. His novels published in English include Gargoyles, The Lime Works, Correction, Concrete, Woodcutters, and Wittgenstein&#39;s Nephew; a number of his plays have been produced off Broadway, at the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, and at theaters in London and throughout Europe. The five segments of his memoir were published in one volume, Gathering Evidence, in 1985.

Who hasn't searched for the right word to describe a colleague's maschalephidrosis (runaway armpit perspiration) or a boss's pleonexia (insane greed)? And what better way is there to insult the scombroid landlord (resembling a mackerel) or that tumbrel of a brother-in-law (a person who is drunk to the point of vomiting) than by calling him by his rightful name?<br> <br>A compact compendium of ingenious words for anyone who's been tongue-tied, flabbergasted, or dumbfounded, <i>Depraved and Insulting English</i> supplies the appropriate vocabulary for any occasion. Word lovers, chronic insulters, berayers, bescumbers, and bespewers need fear no more--finding the correct word to wow your friends or silence your enemies just got a whole lot easier.<br></p><p>A merger has taken place between Peter Novobatzky and Ammon Shea's books <i>Depraved English</i> and <i>Insulting English</i>. The result? <i>Depraved and Insulting English</i>. "Some of the entries are lascivious," the authors say, "some revolting, and others derogatory. A few are all of these things." This book will provide blissful browsing for anyone who ever got a fourth-grade thrill from looking up naughty words in the dictionary or, later, felt a frisson of pleasure from using obscure but racy words that few others understood. Many of the terms here--such as coprolagnia, cypripareunia, hybristophiliac, peotillomian, and sacofricosis--sound downright illicit. More intriguing are the words that sound perfectly acceptable, like blissom, feist, and plooky. But watch out for the plooky fellow who lets out a feist when he blissoms; he's actually a pimply guy who farts silently while copulating with ewes. <i>Eeew.</i> <i>--Jane Steinberg</i><i>Depraved English</i> published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 1999, 0312207735<br><i>Insulting English</i> published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 2001, 0312272081<br></p><h2>Integral Yoga Hatha for Beginners (Revised)</h2><p>This booklet offers the essential practices of the popular Integral Yoga Hatha class.
